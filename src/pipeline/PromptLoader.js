DOMAIN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

Step 1: Domain Identification
Look for keywords and context that indicate business domains. Use these as examples and patterns:
Transportation/Logistics: driver, delivery, rideshare, vehicle, fleet, logistics, shipping, route, dispatch 
Healthcare: patient, medical, doctor, appointment, clinic, hospital, prescription, insurance 
Finance: payment, banking, transaction, account, money, credit, loan, investment, tax 
E-commerce: shopping, product, cart, order, purchase, inventory, customer, checkout 
Education: student, teacher, course, grade, school, classroom, assignment, enrollment
Business/SaaS: settings, dashboard, profile, team, workspace, analytics, management

YOUR TASK:
Analyze this user request and create a Product Requirements Document.

User Request: [USER_INPUT]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Product Requirements Document: [Feature Name]

Domain Analysis
Primary Domain: [Transportation/Healthcare/Finance/E-commerce/Education/Business] 
Confidence Level: [High 90%+ | Medium 70-89% | Low <70%] 
Key Evidence: [Specific words/phrases that indicate this domain] 

User Profile
Primary Users: [Specific user types with demographics/context] 
Usage Context: [When, where, how they use this - be specific] 
Primary Goals: [What they're trying to accomplish]

Core Use Cases
[Use Case Name]: [Specific scenario - who does what, when, why]

Functional Requirements
[Function Area Name] [Priority: Critical/High/Medium/Low]
Purpose: [Why this function exists from business perspective] 
Core Capabilities: [Specific things users can do] 

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
Focus on BUSINESS LOGIC and USER NEEDS, not design solutions
Be specific about user types - avoid generic "users"
Include domain-specific workflows and compliance requirements
