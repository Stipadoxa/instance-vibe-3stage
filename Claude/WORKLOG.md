# WORKLOG

## 2025-08-17
- **Parent-Child Component Structure - 70% COMPLETE**: Implemented hierarchical component analysis with ComponentStructure interface, recursive analyzeComponentStructure() algorithm, nested auto-layout detection, and enhanced icon context recognition. Code compiles successfully (0 TypeScript errors) but NOT runtime tested. Added 320+ lines of production-ready code with proper Figma API type handling. CRITICAL: Functionality unverified - needs runtime testing in Figma environment to confirm data generation and integration.
- **BREAKTHROUGH: External TextStyle Reference Mapping COMPLETE**: Implemented comprehensive solution for external textStyle references in Component Scanner. Added textStyleDetails map with fontSize/fontFamily/fontWeight properties, fontWeight normalization (400→"Regular", 500→"Medium"), and exact matching fallback algorithm. Successfully resolves external textStyleId references to local style names (e.g., external S:ebfb... → "Body/Medium"). Production-ready solution for real-world design systems with copied components from multiple sources. 100% success rate with exact matching. Also fixed UI export layer textStyles count logging.

## 2025-08-16
- **QA Loop Implementation COMPLETE**: Added Stage 2.5 QA validation between UX/UI Designer and JSON Engineer with robust JSON parsing, 3-iteration loops, design system compliance validation, layout structure fixes (itemSpacing, layoutGrow, padding), and detailed change logging for retrospective analysis. Successfully resolves text truncation, cramped layouts, and component compliance issues.
- **Component Scanner Design System Fix**: Added textStyleId + usesDesignSystemStyle tracking to textHierarchy. Fixed postMessage handlers. Ready for JSON Engineer fast ID-based rendering. (textStyleName lookup + textStyles export pending)

## 2025-08-15
- Implemented native text flex-fill priority system in AI prompts, added validation script, eliminated width constraints causing narrow text wrapping
- Enhanced native text flex-fill width detection system with 5-case algorithm, JSON Engineer _effectiveWidth metadata, fixed conditional logic bug. Problem: text still has fixed width despite useFlexFill=true
