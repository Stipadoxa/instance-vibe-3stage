# AI Debug Log - Tracking Actual Prompts Sent to Gemini

## Purpose
This document tracks every actual prompt sent to the Gemini AI to debug the caching issue where different user inputs result in the same SaaS landing page responses.

## Current Test Request
From user-request.txt: "Design a completely unique purple dashboard for managing pet appointments with calendar integration and animated dog icons."

## Expected Behavior
The AI should process the pet appointment dashboard request, not return cached SaaS landing page responses.

## Debug Run Log

### Run: 20250801_095739

#### Stage 1: User Request Analyzer

**ISSUE FOUND!** The prompt correctly contains the pet appointment request, but the AI responds with a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SaaS landing page request.

**Prompt sent to AI:**
- Length: 7,188 characters
- Contains the correct user request: "Design a completely unique purple dashboard for managing pet appointments with calendar integration and animated dog icons."
- Ends with: "...Remember: Not every screen needs to be special. The magic happens when you enhance systematically..."

**Response received:**
- AI completely ignored the actual request and returned: "Design a landing page for our new SaaS product, focusing on attracting enterprise clients..."
- This is NOT what was in the prompt at all!

#### Stage 2: UX UI Designer  
**Prompt sent to AI:**
- Length: 301,856 characters (includes design system data)
- Uses the incorrect SaaS response from Stage 1 as input

**Response received:**
- Designed a SaaS landing page (as expected, since it received the wrong input from Stage 1)

#### Stage 3: JSON Engineer
**Prompt sent to AI:**
- Length: 11,113 characters
- Also based on the incorrect SaaS design from Stage 2

**Response received:**
- Generated JSON for SaaS landing page

## Analysis - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**The issue is NOT caching - it's the Gemini AI model itself returning completely different content than what's in the prompt.**

This appears to be:
1. **Model behavior issue** - Gemini is generating responses that don't match the input prompt
2. **Possible training data influence** - The model may be defaulting to common SaaS landing page examples from its training
3. **Prompt injection or override** - Something in the prompt structure may be causing the model to ignore the actual user request

**Next Steps:**
1. Check if there are hidden characters or formatting issues in the prompt
2. Try a completely different prompt structure 
3. Test with a different AI model to isolate the issue
4. Check if there are any prompt injection attacks or conflicts in the prompt template
