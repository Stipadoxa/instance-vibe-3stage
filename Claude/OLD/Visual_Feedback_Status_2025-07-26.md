# Visual Feedback Pipeline Status - July 26, 2025

## What Was Completed

### 1. Design System Data Transmission - FIXED
- **Issue**: AI received template placeholders instead of actual component data
- **Root Cause**: Missing `{{DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA}}` placeholder in prompt template
- **Solution**: Added placeholder to `visual-improvement-analyzer.txt`
- **Result**: AI now receives 118k+ chars of real component data

### 2. Complete UX Designer Output Transmission - IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: Stage 4 only received layout part, not complete Stage 2 output
- **Solution**: Updated `format_visual_analyzer_prompt()` to pass full output
- **Result**: Stage 4 now receives both `designRationale` + `layoutContainer`

### 3. Minimal Edits Approach - WORKING
- **Implementation**: Updated prompt to preserve original and make surgical fixes only
- **Result**: AI correctly identifies visual problems and makes targeted changes
- **Evidence**: Moves timestamps from mixed text to separate fields, adds missing components

## What Currently Works

### Stage 4 (Visual UX Designer)
- ✅ Receives real design system data (not templates)
- ✅ Analyzes screenshots and identifies genuine visual problems
- ✅ Makes conservative improvements only when score < 75
- ✅ Preserves original layout structure and makes minimal changes
- ✅ Identifies specific issues: "100+ overlapping with text", "missing navigation"

### Data Flow Stage 4 → Stage 5
- ✅ All improvement data transmits correctly
- ✅ Notification content ("Meeting Reminder", "System Update") reaches Stage 5
- ✅ Improvements ("100+" separation, navigation addition) are passed through
- ✅ Manual format conversion to Stage 2 format works

### Pipeline Architecture
- ✅ Can run full pipeline Stage 1-3 successfully
- ✅ JSON Engineer processes original Stage 2 output correctly
- ✅ Design system validation working (when format is correct)

## Issues Still Requiring Fixes

### 1. Property Format Consistency - PARTIALLY FIXED
- **Issue**: Stage 4 outputs `"type"` but Stage 2 uses `"suggestedType"`
- **Status**: Prompt examples fixed, but AI still outputs `"type"`
- **Next**: May need additional prompt iteration to enforce consistency

### 2. Props Structure Mismatch - IDENTIFIED
- **Issue**: Stage 4 wraps content in `"props": {}` but Stage 2 has content directly under component
- **Status**: Manually tested fix works for data transmission
- **Next**: Update Stage 4 prompt to remove `"props"` wrapper

### 3. JSON Engineer Processing - NOT WORKING
- **Issue**: Even with correct format, JSON Engineer generates generic "Settings Option" instead of processing improvements
- **Evidence**: Receives notification improvements correctly but ignores them
- **Status**: Root cause unknown, may be prompt issue or format detail still missing
- **Next**: Debug JSON Engineer prompt or compare exact format differences

### 4. Invalid Variant Suggestions - ONGOING
- **Issue**: AI suggests `"Trailing": "Badge"` which doesn't exist in design system
- **Available**: `["Check Box", "Icon", "None", "Radio Button", "Switch"]`
- **Next**: Strengthen design system validation in prompt

## Testing Results

### Manual Pipeline Tests
- **Stage 1-3**: Works perfectly, generates valid Figma JSON
- **Stage 4 analysis**: Correctly identifies visual problems with evidence
- **Stage 4→5 data flow**: All improvement data transmits
- **Stage 5 processing**: Fails to process improvements, generates generic output

### Format Compatibility Tests
- **Original vs improved format**: Manually fixing format enables data transmission
- **`"suggestedType"` vs `"type"`**: Format difference confirmed as blocking issue
- **`"props"` wrapper**: Confirmed as additional blocking factor

## Priority for Tomorrow

### High Priority (Blocking)
1. **Fix Stage 4 output format**: Ensure `"suggestedType"` and no `"props"` wrapper
2. **Debug JSON Engineer**: Determine why it ignores improvements even with correct format
3. **Test end-to-end**: Run complete Stage 4→5 pipeline with fixes

### Medium Priority 
1. **Strengthen variant validation**: Prevent invalid suggestions like "Badge"
2. **Test with different UI types**: Verify works beyond notifications
3. **Performance optimization**: Review token usage and execution times

### Low Priority
1. **Integration with main pipeline**: Update `instance.py` for production use
2. **Documentation**: Update prompts and process documentation

## Current Blocker

The main blocker is JSON Engineer not processing improvements despite receiving correct format and data. Until this is resolved, Stage 4 improvements cannot generate proper Figma-ready JSON.

## Files Modified
- `/src/prompts/roles/visual-improvement-analyzer.txt` - Added placeholder, updated format rules
- `/instance.py` - Updated `format_visual_analyzer_prompt()` function  
- `/manual_stage4_test.py` - Updated to use correct placeholder
- `/manual_stage5_test.py` - Added format conversion logic
