# MVP Development Plan: UX/UI Design Automation System

## Overview
Transform your current prototype into a stable MVP ready for friend testing. Focus on making the core engine work reliably across different design systems rather than perfecting the interface.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Stabilization üîß
**Goal:** Make your scanner + AI engine work on external design systems, not just your own.

#### 1.1 Test with Friend's Design System (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ
- **Action:** Get one design system from a designer colleague
- **Test:** 
  - Does the plugin crash during scan?
  - Does it find any components in the logs?
  - Can it generate a simple element that worked on your DS?
- **Success:** Identify and fix the first major compatibility issue
- **Status:** COMPLETED - FFriends DS tested successfully (3/3 generations passed)

#### 1.2 Test with Public Design Systems (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Action:** Download 2-3 popular DS from Figma Community
  - Recommended: Untitled UI, Material Design Kit
- **Test:** Look for issues with:
  - Different naming separators (`/`, `-`, `_`)
  - Various naming logic (`Button/Primary` vs `btn-primary`)
  - Scanner hanging on large component libraries
- **Success:** Scanner handles different naming conventions without crashing

#### 1.3 Implement Error Handling (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Action:** Add robust error handling based on previous test findings
- **Requirement:** Scanner must not crash on unusual components
- **Behavior:** Unknown/broken components should be logged and skipped
- **Success:** Plugin remains stable on any design system

### Phase 2: UI Cleanup üé®
**Goal:** Simplify interface to focus on core functionality without distractions.

#### 2.1 Simplify to Essentials (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Keep only:**
  - Large text input field for requests
  - Clear "Generate" button
  - Optional "Scan Library" button (if not automatic)
- **Remove:** Everything else that might confuse or distract

#### 2.2 Add Progress Indicators (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **During generation:** Show spinner or "Thinking..." message
- **After completion:** Clear "Done!" or "Failed, try again" message
- **Success:** User always knows the current state

#### 2.3 Add Usage Example (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Action:** Add placeholder text in input field
- **Example:** `"Create a login screen with a logo and two fields"`
- **Success:** Users immediately understand the expected format

### Phase 3: Feedback Preparation üìä
**Goal:** Set up systems to gather actionable feedback from testers.

#### 3.1 Implement Feedback Collection (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Action:** Add "Something went wrong" button/link
- **Behavior:** Copies user's request text + error info to clipboard
- **Success:** Easy bug reporting for testers

## MVP Validation Tests

### Login Screen Test ‚úÖ
**Test Prompt:** `"Create mobile login screen with logo, email field, password field, 'Sign in' button, and 'Forgot password?' link"`

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- Uses actual components (`input-field`, `button`) not rectangles
- Proper vertical Auto Layout structure
- Correct element order
- Handles unknown components gracefully (creates placeholder text nodes)

**Not Required for MVP:**
- Icons inside input fields
- Prototyping connections
- Pixel-perfect spacing

### Settings Screen Test ‚öôÔ∏è
**Test Prompt:** `"Create settings page with 'Settings' title, 'Profile' section with avatar and name, 'Notifications' section with 'Push notifications' item and toggle"`

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- Uses components (`avatar`, `list-item`, `toggle`)
- Creates separate Auto Layout frames for sections
- Proper text placement for titles
- Correct horizontal layout for list items

**Not Required for MVP:**
- Section dividers
- Navigation arrows
- Different toggle states

## Final Readiness Criteria

### Ready for Friend Testing When:
- ‚úÖ Login test passes consistently (5 times in a row)
- ‚úÖ Settings test passes consistently 
- ‚úÖ Works on 2-3 different external design systems
- ‚úÖ Your reaction to results: *"Just need to tweak spacing and replace one placeholder - this saved me 5 minutes"*

### Not Ready If:
- ‚ùå Your reaction: *"Need to rebuild everything"*

## Success Metrics
- **80% structural accuracy** - Most components are correct
- **Time savings** - Faster than building from scratch
- **Stability** - No crashes on external design systems
- **User clarity** - Testers can operate without explanation

## Current Status
- **Phase:** 1.1 (Testing with friend's design system)
- **Next Action:** Contact designer colleague for test design system
- **Priority:** Get external validation before building additional features
