# Defensive Native Elements Implementation - Handoff Report

## Work Completed
Added comprehensive defensive handling for native elements with invalid child items in the Figma renderer (`src/core/figma-renderer.ts`).

## Problem Addressed
Native elements (native-text, native-rectangle, native-circle) cannot have child items in Figma's architecture, but malformed JSON was causing crashes when these elements contained `items` or `properties.items` arrays.

## Solution Implemented
Added defensive conversion logic in both processing loops (lines ~211 and ~2743) that:

1. **Detects invalid structures**: Checks if native elements have items
2. **Safely converts**: Transforms problematic natives to `layoutContainer`
3. **Preserves styling**: Transfers visual properties (background, corners, padding, dimensions) 
4. **Logs conversions**: Clear warnings and conversion details for debugging
5. **Processes correctly**: Routes converted containers through proper layout logic

## Key Code Pattern
```typescript
// Safe defensive conversion for native elements with children
if (item.type?.startsWith('native-') && (item.items || item.properties?.items)) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ Invalid structure: ${item.type} cannot have child items`);
  // Convert to layoutContainer while preserving styling
  // Process as container instead of crashing
}
```

## Build Fix
Resolved build failure by moving deleted .js prompt files back from backup directory to restore imports.

## Impact
- Prevents renderer crashes from malformed JSON
- Maintains visual fidelity through style preservation
- Provides clear debugging feedback
- Makes system more robust against edge cases

## Files Modified
- `src/core/figma-renderer.ts` - Added defensive handling in 2 locations
- Moved prompt .js files from backup to restore build

## Next Agent Notes
The defensive handling is now in place and working. Monitor console logs for conversion warnings to identify sources of malformed JSON. Consider adding validation at JSON generation stage to prevent these structures from being created.
