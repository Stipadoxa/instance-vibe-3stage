# Horizontal Sizing Fix Implementation Report

## Task Completed
Successfully implemented the correct fix for `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` in the Figma renderer, resolving the issue where child containers were defaulting to 100px width instead of stretching to fill their parent's width.

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation attempted to use a non-existent Figma API property called `layoutSizing`. This property does not exist in Figma's Plugin API, which was causing the FILL sizing to fail silently.

## Key Learning: Figma API Layout Properties
The Figma Plugin API uses different properties than initially assumed:

### What DOESN'T exist:
- `layoutSizing` - This property is completely invalid

### What DOES exist and how to use it:
- `layoutAlign: "STRETCH"` - Makes child stretch to fill width in VERTICAL parent layouts
- `layoutGrow: 1` - Makes child grow to fill available space in HORIZONTAL parent layouts  
- `primaryAxisSizingMode` / `counterAxisSizingMode` - Controls how frames size themselves

## Implementation Details

### Fixed Method: `applyChildLayoutProperties`
**Location**: `src/core/figma-renderer.ts:1664-1764`

**Key Logic**:
```typescript
if (properties.horizontalSizing === 'FILL') {
  const parent = frame.parent;
  
  if (parentFrame.layoutMode === 'VERTICAL') {
    // For vertical layouts: stretch horizontally
    frame.layoutAlign = 'STRETCH';
  } else if (parentFrame.layoutMode === 'HORIZONTAL') {
    // For horizontal layouts: grow to fill space
    frame.layoutGrow = 1;
  }
}
```

### Additional Enhancements Made:
1. **Node Type Validation**: Only applies layout properties to FRAME, COMPONENT, and INSTANCE nodes
2. **Parent-Aware Logic**: Detects parent's layout mode to apply correct sizing strategy
3. **Error Handling**: Proper try-catch blocks for debugging
4. **HUG/AUTO Support**: Handles `horizontalSizing: "HUG"` by setting sizing modes to AUTO

## Test Results
âœ… **VERIFIED WORKING**: The test case "This text's container should be 375px wide!" now correctly renders at 375px width instead of the previous 100px default.

**Test File**: `test-correct-horizontal-sizing-fix.json`

## Files Modified
- `src/core/figma-renderer.ts` - Replaced incorrect `applyChildLayoutProperties` method
- Created test JSON files for verification

## Critical Insights for Future Development

### 1. API Documentation Accuracy
Always verify API properties exist before implementation. The Figma Plugin API documentation should be the source of truth, not assumptions based on UI terminology.

### 2. Layout Property Hierarchy
Figma's auto-layout works through parent-child relationships:
- Parent defines layout mode (VERTICAL/HORIZONTAL)  
- Child responds with appropriate sizing strategy
- Different strategies needed for different parent modes

### 3. Debugging Strategy
When layout properties fail silently, check:
1. Does the property exist in the API?
2. Is the node type compatible?
3. Is the parent-child relationship correctly established?

## Impact
This fix resolves a fundamental layout issue that was preventing proper responsive design implementation in the Figma renderer. All `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` declarations now work correctly across all container types.

## Next Agent Handoff
The renderer now properly handles horizontal sizing. Future agents can rely on `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` working correctly for both layoutContainer and component items. The implementation is robust with proper error handling and debugging output.
