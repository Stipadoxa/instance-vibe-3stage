# Discovered Problems

1. User's design system export can exceed Gemini's token limits, causing complete pipeline failure without clear user feedback.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. render reveals:
 
 
 Native text renders 100px w
 Horizobtal autlayout renders  100px h
 
 
 Designer drops in text without paddings and bottom nav wider than root. DOES NOT HAVE AVARENES OF ROOT'S / Screen's limitations
 Apper Navigation in same container with content > causing paddings next to viewport limits
 appbar hugs instead of filling root
 does not use typography (ceck in JSON)
