üìù Original User Request:
create settings page for mobile app. reference to image for content but use our components from design system provided.

üìã Analyzed Requirements:

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage notification preferences, update personal information.
Secondary Goals:  Understand account status (e.g., "Verified ID" badge), access help resources (e.g., "What is it?"), securely log out of the application.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential interruptions during use.

üé® Designer Rationale:
{
  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout is a single-column list to maximize vertical space on mobile, mirroring the reference image.  Consistent spacing (24px) between list items ensures readability and prevents visual clutter. Section headers are visually distinct to improve scannability.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user flows linearly through the settings options, following a top-to-bottom pattern.  Toggles offer immediate feedback, while actions like 'Change Password' likely navigate to a new screen.  The 'What is it?' tooltip provides quick clarification.",
    "componentChoices": "The `listItem` component is used for each setting, offering clear visual distinction. Toggles (`switch`) provide on/off controls for relevant settings.  A tooltip (`tooltip`) component clarifies the 'Verified ID' badge and is considered instead of a modal to avoid disrupting the user flow. The design prioritizes the use of a single component instance wherever the array property allows for it.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Section headers (using `Title/Medium` text style) establish clear visual groupings.  The 'Delete my account permanently' option is presented last, as a critical action that requires more user attention.  Active states and visual cues provide immediate feedback on setting status."
  }
}

üîß Engineer Rationale:
{
  "implementationRationale": {
    "componentSelection": "The provided design uses a `list-item` component for each setting.  The `divider` component is used to separate the title from the settings list.  A `tooltip` component is added to the \"Verified ID\" list item as specified in the input.  There is no explicit component ID for the text, it is rendered as native-text.",
    "styleApplication": "Text styles (`Title/Large`, `Title/Medium`, `Body/Medium`) and color styles (e.g., `Neutral/neutral90`, `Primary/primary50`) are applied directly to the components as specified in the input. Color styles are preserved as string references.",
    "designSystemMapping": "The design uses a consistent set of components from the design system. The mapping is straightforward: `list-item` for settings, `text` for titles, and `divider` for visual separation. The `tooltip` is used for the 'What is it?' clarification.  There is no component ID for text elements; they are treated as native text.",
    "variantDecisions": "The `divider` component uses the `Position: horizontal` and `Type: full-width` variants.  The `list-item` component variants are determined by whether the item has a leading switch, trailing text or icon or neither. No other variants are explicitly defined in the input."
