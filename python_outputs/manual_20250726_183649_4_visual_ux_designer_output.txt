      "The screenshot shows the '100+' count overlapping with the notification text, making it difficult to read.",
      "The design system does not appear to have a component that directly handles the notification count in this way.  The current implementation creates a visual conflict."

  "improvedLayoutData": {
    "designRationale": {
      "layoutDecisions": "The layout is structured vertically to accommodate the notification list, with the app bar at the top and bottom navigation at the bottom.  Item spacing is minimized for efficient use of screen real estate on mobile.",
      "userFlowReasoning": "Users can view notifications in a scrollable list, potentially tapping on an item for details.  The top bar displays user information and the bottom navigation offers access to other app sections.",
      "componentChoices": "I chose the 'appbar' (id: 10:5620) for the top bar, 'list-item' (id: 10:10214) for each notification, and 'Bottom navigation' (id: 10:4724) for the bottom bar.  I considered using a 'navigation' component for the top bar, but 'appbar' offers better visual consistency with a typical mobile app structure and the ability to include user information.  The 'list-item' provides a robust structure for complex notifications, easily accommodating avatars, titles, descriptions, and timestamps, providing more structure than 'text' or 'card' components which lack such built-in capabilities. The 'Bottom navigation' is a standard solution for bottom bars, providing better design than a custom layout.",
      "visualHierarchy": "The visual hierarchy is established through component choices and text styles. The app bar acts as a clear header, with the list items containing primary text (title) in a larger font than secondary text (description), and the bottom navigation providing clear visual distinction.",
      "variantSelectionRationale": "For the 'list-item', I chose 'Condition=2-line', 'Leading=Image', 'Trailing=None', 'Show overline=False', 'Show supporting text=True' to accommodate a concise yet informative notification display.  Alternatives were rejected due to mobile screen constraints: '3-line+' could create overly long list entries, and adding a 'Trailing' element (Check Box, Icon, etc.) adds unnecessary complexity for quick scanning and mobile-sized screens."
