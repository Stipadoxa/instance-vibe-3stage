Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain focused on product discovery
User Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products across various categories.
Platform Impact: Mobile users expect a streamlined experience with intuitive navigation and touch-friendly interactions. Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Search for products across different categories, browse available product categories.
Secondary Goals:  Quickly access desired product categories, efficient navigation between categories.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Search bar functions correctly, tabs are clearly labeled and tappable, scrolling is smooth and responsive, and category content loads correctly.

Content Requirements
Critical: Search bar in the app bar, scrollable tabs labeled "electronics," "home goods," and "vehicles."  Placeholder content or loading indicators for each tab.
Supporting:  Visual indicators of active tab.
Contextual: Search results (displayed on a separate screen or as part of a modal), error messages if search or tab loading fails.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: App bar containing search bar. Scrollable tab layout below the app bar. Each tab displays a list of relevant products.
* Components: App bar with search bar (text field, search icon), scrollable tabs (tab labels, indicator). Product list (Product cards with images and brief descriptions would likely be on subsequent screens reached by selecting a tab)
* Styling:  Adherence to platform design guidelines (e.g., Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS).


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Search for products, select a product category tab.
Secondary Actions:  None directly on this screen; navigation to a product list screen is implied.
Screen States: Default (tabs visible with placeholder content), loading (loading indicator displayed), error (error message displayed).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on active tab, appropriate loading indicators, informative error messages.
