  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain focused on product discovery\nUser Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products across various categories.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined interface with easily accessible search and intuitive navigation; limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space; touch interaction is primary.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Search for products using keywords, browse products across different categories.\nSecondary Goals: Quickly switch between product categories, potentially filter or sort search results (though not explicitly stated, it's a common e-commerce secondary goal).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Search bar is functional and prominent within the app bar, tabs are clearly labeled and easily tappable, scrolling is smooth and responsive, and loading states are handled gracefully.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Search bar, \"electronics,\" \"home goods,\" and \"vehicles\" tabs, product listings (though the specifics are not defined).\nSupporting:  Potentially, a \"loading\" indicator while tabs load, or while the search performs.\nContextual:  Product listings will be contextual to the selected tab, and search results will be contextual to the search query.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** App bar containing a search bar, scrollable tabs below the app bar, scrollable product listing area below tabs.\n*   **Components:** App Bar (with search bar), Scrollable Tabs (\"electronics,\" \"home goods,\" \"vehicles\"), Product Listing area (details unspecified).\n*   **Styling:**  (Unspecified - to be determined based on branding guidelines).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Perform a product search, select a product category tab.\nSecondary Actions: (None explicitly specified, but could include filtering or sorting options, depending on further design choices).\nScreen States: Default state (showing tabs and a potentially empty product list), loading state (while fetching data),  search results state (displaying search results).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback (loading indicators) during search and tab selection, relevant error messages if data retrieval fails.\n",
