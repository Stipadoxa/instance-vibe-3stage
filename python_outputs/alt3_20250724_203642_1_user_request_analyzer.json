  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management\nUser Type: Mobile app users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined settings page with clear, concise options and large, touchable elements.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information architecture.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage preferences, control app behavior.\nSecondary Goals: Understand the meaning of less-obvious settings; easily locate specific settings.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, limited attention span.\nReady for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are included, using existing app components; navigation is clear and intuitive; touch targets meet minimum size requirements; and the overall design follows the provided visual style guide and maintains consistency with the app's design system.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details, Business details, Access to Cars45 auction (with active/inactive toggle), \"Verified ID\" badge (with explanation), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats, Disable Feedback, Manage notifications, Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  Clear section headers and visual separators to improve readability.\nContextual:  \"What is it?\" explanations for settings that may not be self-explanatory (e.g., \"Verified ID\" badge).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single column list of settings, using existing app components for each setting (as per design system). Top and bottom app navigation bars are included.\n* Components:  Each setting is represented as a row in the list; each row includes a setting label and, if applicable, a secondary element like a toggle, value display, or secondary action (e.g., \"What is it?\" link).  Existing app components must be used, following design specifications.\n* Styling:  The overall styling should align with the reference image and the app's existing design system.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Navigating to different setting sections, toggling settings (on/off), initiating a setting change (e.g., changing email).\nSecondary Actions: Accessing further information on a setting via \"What is it?\" link (where applicable).\nScreen States: Default state (settings list displayed), loading state (if applicable, during certain actions like changing a password), success state (after successfully changing a setting), and error states (if any setting changes fail).\nFeedback Needs:  Visual indicators for changes (e.g., toggles showing on/off), confirmation messages on successful setting updates, clear and concise error messages indicating reasons for failure.\n",
