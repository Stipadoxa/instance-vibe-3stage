  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Authentication domain, potentially part of a larger onboarding flow.\nUser Type: Mobile users encountering the application for the first time.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users expect concise, clear messaging.  Limited screen real estate necessitates brevity.  Touch interaction is primary.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Acknowledge successful login/account creation; welcome the user to the application.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially link to next steps (e.g., tutorial, main screen).\nUser Constraints:  Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if:  The \"Welcome!\" text is displayed prominently and is clearly visible against the background; the text color is green as specified.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: \"Welcome!\" text (green).\nSupporting:  None specified.  Could include a brief secondary message or next-step call to action (e.g., \"Let's get started!\").\nContextual:  None specified.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Text centered on the screen.\n* Components:  A single text element.\n* Styling: Text color: Green.  Font size and style should be appropriate for mobile readability.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Implicitly proceed to the next screen/action.\nSecondary Actions:  None specified.\nScreen States:  Single state (showing \"Welcome!\").\nFeedback Needs:  None specified, though a loading indicator *might* be beneficial if this screen is displayed while other processes complete (e.g., loading user data).\n",
