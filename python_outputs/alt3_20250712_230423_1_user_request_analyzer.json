  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Settings management within a mobile application.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact:  Mobile users require a concise and intuitive settings screen due to limited screen real estate.  Touch interactions must be considered, and the design should account for interruptions and varying network conditions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal account details, change contact information, manage language preferences, delete account.\nSecondary Goals:  Easily log out of the application.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices, reliance on touch interaction, potential for interruptions during use.\nReady for handoff if: All settings options are clearly presented, top app bar and bottom navigation are implemented correctly,  touch targets are appropriately sized, and all actions result in clear visual feedback.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details section (displaying current information), \"Change phone number\" option, \"Change email\" option, \"Change language\" option, \"Delete my account permanently\" option, \"Log out\" option.\nSupporting:  Clear indication of currently selected language.\nContextual:  Confirmation dialog before account deletion.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical list of settings items.\n* Components: Top app bar (with app title/icon),  individual settings rows (with labels and potentially indicators), bottom navigation bar (with standard navigation options).\n* Styling:  Consistent with overall app styling guidelines.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Change phone number, change email, change language, delete account, log out.\nSecondary Actions:  View/edit personal details.\nScreen States: Default state (showing all settings), loading state (while saving changes), confirmation dialog (before account deletion), success/error messages (after performing actions).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback after each setting change (e.g., updated values, success messages), confirmation dialog before irreversible actions (account deletion).\n\n",
