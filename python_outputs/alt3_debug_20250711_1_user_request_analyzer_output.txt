Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates efficient layout.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.
Secondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials (link to password reset flow), use convenient login options (consider this for future iterations).
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, all form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, placeholder text is clear and concise, error messages have designated space, and sufficient padding/spacing around elements prevents accidental touches.


Content Requirements
Critical: Heading (e.g., "Login"), Email field (with appropriate keyboard type), Password field (with secure input masking), Submit button (clearly labeled "Login").
Supporting: Password recovery link (linking to a separate password reset screen),  "Remember me" checkbox (optional, but recommended for user convenience).
Contextual: Error messages (displayed below respective fields or as a summary), loading indicator (during authentication).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout to maximize vertical space usage.
* Components: Heading (H1 or H2), Email input field, Password input field, Submit button.
* Styling:  Consider platform-consistent styling guidelines for mobile login screens.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Submit login credentials.
Secondary Actions: Initiate password recovery (via link).
Screen States: Default state (form fields visible), loading state (spinner/progress indicator shown), error state (error messages displayed).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.
