I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below are verified to exist within the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to organize elements logically.  The email and password input fields are stacked vertically, followed by the login button and "Forgot password" link.  Consistent spacing (16px padding) is used to improve readability and visual separation between elements. Input fields use `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to occupy full width for a clean, mobile-first design.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward: users enter their email and password, click "Login," and can access the "Forgot password" link if needed.  This common login pattern ensures ease of use.

4. **Component Choices:**
    * **Email Input Field:** I chose the `"10:8492"` (`text input`) component over alternatives like the text area (`10:8619`) because the email address is typically a single line of text. The text input component is more suitable for this short-form input.
    * **Password Input Field:**  I used the `"10:8492"` (`text input`) component again, leveraging its ability to support masked input for security (though this functionality isn't explicitly defined in the component schema, it's a common expectation for password fields and easily implemented).  A dedicated password field component was not available in the design system.
    * **Login Button:** The `"10:3907"` (`Button`) component was selected because it provides the necessary button styling and interaction. This was chosen over other visual elements as it best represents a call-to-action. I used the variants: `{"Platform": "Android+Web", "Size": "Medium", "Type": "Filled", "State": "Default", "Color": "Green"}` for a prominent visual appeal.
    * **"Forgot Password" Link:** This is implemented using a `native-text` element styled as a link for consistency with the app guidelines.  A dedicated "link" component wasn't provided within the design system.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a component for password visibility toggles, thus a native element solution was employed to add an eye icon (using component id `"635:4518"`) next to the password input field.  The logic of changing the input's type attribute is assumed to be external to component and native elements implementation.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Prominence is established through the use of the filled green button for the primary action ("Login"). The email and password labels are clearly visible above the respective input fields. "Forgot password" is styled as a secondary action, using smaller text and subdued color for less visual weight.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** The "Medium" size variant was chosen for the login button to balance screen space and usability.  The "Filled" type ensures visual clarity and user feedback. The "Default" state is appropriate for the initial display. The "Green" color variant was selected to signal a positive and confirming action.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  A `native-text` element is used for the "Forgot password?" link because no dedicated link component was available in the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`. This native element allows the text to be styled appropriately to indicate a clickable element and maintains a design consistent with the app guidelines.
