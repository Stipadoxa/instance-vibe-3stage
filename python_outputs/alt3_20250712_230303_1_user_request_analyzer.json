  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: User settings management within a mobile application.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise layout, clear touch targets, and consideration for interruptions and limited screen real estate.  The bottom navigation bar will likely need to be a persistent element.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Modify personal details (phone, email, language), delete account, log out.\nSecondary Goals: Easily access and modify settings.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if: All primary actions are clearly labeled and accessible with appropriate touch targets;  top app bar and bottom navigation are consistently implemented across different screen states;  error handling is implemented for actions like account deletion.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Personal details display (current values), \"Change phone number\" option, \"Change email\" option, \"Change language\" option, \"Delete my account permanently\" option, \"Log out\" option.\nSupporting:  Account information summary (e.g., account creation date).\nContextual:  Confirmation dialog before account deletion, success/error messages after actions are completed.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical list of settings items below the top app bar, above the bottom navigation bar.\n* Components: Top app bar (with title, back button, or other navigation elements), list items (each with a setting title and an action or indicator of current value), bottom navigation.\n* Styling:  Consistent with overall app styling guidelines.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Change phone number, change email, change language, delete account, log out.\nSecondary Actions:  (Potentially) View account details.\nScreen States:  Default state, loading state (if applicable during actions), confirmation dialog (for account deletion), success/error states after actions.\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of successful changes (e.g., updated values), confirmation dialog before account deletion, error messages indicating failure.\n",
