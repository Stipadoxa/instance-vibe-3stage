  "content": "## STAGE 1: UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST\n\nThis request belongs to the **E-commerce** domain. The platform context is **unclear**, though a mobile implementation is assumed in Stage 3. The user wants to display a concise representation of a seller's information, likely within a product listing or search results page, to allow users to quickly assess seller trustworthiness and potentially navigate to their store.\n\n\n## STAGE 2: GENERATE CORE CONTENT\n\n**Main Screen Purpose**: To display seller information within a product listing or marketplace search, enabling users to identify and vet sellers before making a purchase.\n\n**Required Information & Actions**:\n\n* **Heading**:  (None needed; this is a row within a larger interface)\n* **Key Information Blocks**:\n    * **Avatar Image**: A square, 50x50 pixel profile picture of the seller.  Example:  [Image of a smiling person]\n    * **Seller Name**:  The seller's store or business name. Example: \"EcoFriendlyGoods\"\n    * **Seller Rating**: A numerical rating (e.g., 4.8 out of 5 stars) accompanied by the number of ratings in parentheses. Example: \"4.8 (1234)\"\n* **Primary & Secondary Actions**:\n    * **Navigation to Seller Profile**:  A tappable area encompassing the entire row leading to the seller's full profile page.  (No explicit button needed, the entire row acts as the CTA).\n* **Required Status Indicators**: None explicitly required for this row.\n\n\n**Content Examples:**\n\n- **Seller with high rating:** [Avatar Image of a person]  \"ArtisanCrafts\"  4.9 (876)\n- **Seller with lower rating:** [Avatar Image of a person] \"QuickShipDeals\" 3.2 (21)\n- **No data:** (If there is a problem retrieving seller data) This area will show only a placeholder indicating the seller's data is currently unavailable\n\n\n## STAGE 3: ADD NAVIGATION\n\n**Mobile App Navigation:**\n\nThis row is assumed to be part of a larger screen (product listing or search results).  Therefore, only the surrounding screen's navigation is relevant.\n\n* **Top Navigation**:  \"Back\" (Icon: Left-pointing arrow)\n* **Bottom Navigation**:  \"Home\" (Icon: House), \"Search\" (Icon: Magnifying glass), \"Cart\" (Icon: Shopping cart), \"Profile\" (Icon: Person)\n\n\nNote:  The specific bottom navigation elements will depend on the overall app structure, but these are common in e-commerce apps.  The seller profile row itself doesn't require independent top or bottom navigation.\n",
