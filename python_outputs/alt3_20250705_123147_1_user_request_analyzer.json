  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain with product discovery\nUser Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products within an e-commerce app.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined search experience with large touch targets and quick access to product categories.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Search for specific products, browse products by category.\nSecondary Goals: Quickly access different product categories, refine search results (this would likely be on a subsequent screen).\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for slow network conditions, interruptions.\nReady for handoff if: Search bar is clearly visible and easily accessible within the app bar, tabs are clearly labeled and easily tappable, scrolling is smooth and responsive, and a loading indicator is present when data is being fetched.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Search bar within app bar, scrollable tabs labeled \"electronics,\" \"home goods,\" and \"vehicles.\"  Product listings (presumably displayed based on tab selection, potentially a subsequent screen).\nSupporting:  Option to filter or sort products (likely a secondary screen).\nContextual: Loading indicator while fetching product data for a tab, error message if data cannot be retrieved.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** App bar containing search bar.  Scrollable tab layout below the app bar for category selection.  Scrollable list of products below the tabs.\n*   **Components:** AppBar (contains search bar), Scrollable Tabs (\"electronics,\" \"home goods,\" \"vehicles\"), Product List (this would require further specification - likely another screen or detailed requirements document).\n*   **Styling:**  This requires further specification.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Perform a search, select a product category.\nSecondary Actions: (To be defined in a subsequent screen/documentation - e.g., filtering, sorting, viewing a product's details)\nScreen States: Default state (showing all tabs), loading state (while fetching product data), error state (if data cannot be loaded).\nFeedback Needs: Loading indicator for data retrieval, clear visual feedback of the currently selected tab, error message if product data is unavailable.\n",
