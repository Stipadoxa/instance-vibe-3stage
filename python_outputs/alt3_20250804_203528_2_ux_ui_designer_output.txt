**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical `layoutContainer` to arrange the notification settings in a list. Each setting is a `list-item` component with a leading toggle switch and descriptive text.  Item spacing is set to 16 for readability.  The vertical layout allows for easy scanning and management of multiple settings.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user can easily toggle each notification type on or off using the toggle switches.  Clear labels provide context for each setting. The straightforward design allows users to quickly adjust their notification preferences.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `list-item` component (ID: 10:10214) for each notification setting because it provides a structured format for presenting the toggle switch (using `10:9912` with "Selected" variant) and descriptive text for each option.  This is preferable to using a `layoutContainer` for each setting since this approach maintains consistency and offers built-in styling. Alternatives considered were using `card` components (ID: `147:3743`) or native layout containers, but the `list-item` component provides a better balance of structure and design consistency within the design system.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system does not have a dedicated "notification settings" component. However,  the existing `list-item` component effectively serves this function with its support for both leading and trailing elements, and descriptive text.  No workaround was needed because components and their variants meet all user requirements.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  The visual hierarchy is established through the clear vertical ordering of the list items.  Each list item is equally prominent, ensuring all notification types are given the same importance. The `Body/Medium` text style from the design system (ID: `S:bd915a8e249e62bcbd25e1452467f0d46e3e59fc`) provides a clear indication of content.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `switch` component (ID: 10:9912), I chose the "enabled" state for its visual clarity, making it readily apparent to users whether a notification type is active or inactive.  The "false" value for "Icon" is appropriate because no icon is needed for basic on/off toggles.

8. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements were required, as the provided design system components provided sufficient functionality to meet the user's requirements.
