  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable,  this requires further investigation).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential for typos due to touch keyboard.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is clearly the most prominent element, password recovery link is visible and easily accessible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction,  error messages have designated space and are clear,  input validation (e.g., email format check) is implemented.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area.\nSupporting: Password recovery link,  \"Remember me\" checkbox (consider security implications),  link to create an account.\nContextual:  Loading indicator during authentication, specific error messages for invalid credentials (e.g., \"incorrect password,\" \"invalid email\").\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n\n*This section is intentionally left empty as the user request is a brief idea, not a detailed specification.*\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Create new account (link), access help/support (link - consider placement).\nScreen States: Default state (form fields visible), loading state (loading indicator visible), error state (error messages visible), success state (redirect or confirmation message).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n",
