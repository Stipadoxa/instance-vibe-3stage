User Requirements
Primary Goals:  Acknowledge successful login/account creation; welcome the user to the application.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially link to next steps (e.g., tutorial, main screen).
User Constraints:  Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if:  The "Welcome!" text is displayed prominently and is clearly visible against the background; the text color is green as specified.

Content Requirements
Critical: "Welcome!" text (green).
Supporting:  None specified.  Could include a brief secondary message or next-step call to action (e.g., "Let's get started!").
Contextual:  None specified.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Text centered on the screen.
* Components:  A single text element.
* Styling: Text color: Green.  Font size and style should be appropriate for mobile readability.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Implicitly proceed to the next screen/action.
Secondary Actions:  None specified.
Screen States:  Single state (showing "Welcome!").
Feedback Needs:  None specified, though a loading indicator *might* be beneficial if this screen is displayed while other processes complete (e.g., loading user data).
