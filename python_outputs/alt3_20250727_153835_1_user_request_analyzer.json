  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile application users needing to access their accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users are often in distracting environments and need a quick, secure, and touch-friendly interface.  Screen real estate is limited.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Log in using social media accounts; recover forgotten passwords.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All interactive elements have appropriately sized touch targets;  error messages are clearly displayed;  the primary action (login button) is visually prominent and distinct from secondary actions; password recovery link is easily accessible.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), password recovery link.\nContextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials, etc.), loading indicator during authentication.  Footnote regarding Terms & Conditions acceptance upon login.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Likely a single-column layout due to mobile constraints, with fields stacked vertically.\n* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button (\"Log In\"), multiple secondary buttons for social media logins, a hyperlink for password recovery, a footnote for T&C acceptance.\n* Styling:  Specific styling (e.g., colors, fonts, button styles) not specified and should be determined based on the app's existing design language.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Social media logins.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (during authentication), error states (invalid credentials, network issues), success state (redirect to app).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation of email format and password strength (if applicable), clear and concise error messages, visual loading indicator.\n",
