Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile app users who need to view and manage incoming notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display, touch-based interaction, and consideration for screen real estate limitations.  Notifications must be easily scannable due to potential interruptions and limited attention spans.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View incoming notifications, understand notification content (image, title, subtitle), and potentially take action based on notification.
Secondary Goals:  Manage notifications (e.g., mark as read, dismiss), access notification settings (potentially through bottom navigation).
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions impacting image loading.
Ready for handoff if:  All critical content is displayed clearly and concisely, touch targets are appropriately sized, and navigation is intuitive.  Visual hierarchy prioritizes unread notifications.

Content Requirements
Critical: List of notifications (each with image, title, subtitle, and timestamp).
Supporting:  Number of unread notifications (badge or counter).
Contextual:  Loading indicator for images, empty state message ("No notifications"),  "Mark all as read" action (potentially).

Structural & Component Directives
*   Layout: Vertical list of notifications.  Notifications are displayed individually with image, title, subtitle, and timestamp in a horizontal layout.
*   Components: Top app bar (with title/back button), Notification list items (image, title, subtitle, timestamp), Bottom navigation bar.
*   Styling:  Appropriate styling to visually distinguish read vs unread notifications.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification).
Secondary Actions: Mark as read (potentially swipe-to-dismiss), access notification settings (through bottom nav).
Screen States: Default (showing notifications), Loading (while fetching notifications), Empty (no notifications), Error (failure to load notifications).
Feedback Needs: Loading indicator while fetching notifications, visual cue for read/unread notifications.
