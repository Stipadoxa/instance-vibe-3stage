  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain with product discovery\nUser Type: Mobile users browsing product categories\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need quick and intuitive navigation with minimal taps, prioritizing visual discovery of products. Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Browse product categories, initiate a product search.\nSecondary Goals:  Efficiently switch between categories, easily find desired products.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Search bar is functional and clearly visible within the app bar, tabs are easily tappable, and scrolling is smooth and responsive.  All tab labels are visible without truncation.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  \"Electronics,\" \"Home Goods,\" \"Vehicles\" tabs, Search bar. Product listings (placeholder content acceptable for initial handoff).\nSupporting:  Loading indicator for product data, potential for a \"View All\" option (depending on product quantity per category).\nContextual:  Error messages (e.g., network error), search results displayed based on user input.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: App bar with search bar, scrollable horizontal tabs below the app bar. Main content area below tabs to display product listings.\n* Components: App bar (containing search bar), horizontal scrollable tabs, product list container.\n* Styling:  Styling will need to be defined separately.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Initiate a search, select a product category.\nSecondary Actions:  None explicitly specified in the request.  This could include things like filtering and sorting, which might be added in later iterations.\nScreen States: Default state (tabs visible, product list area may be loading), search results state (displaying results matching user input), loading state, error state.\nFeedback Needs: Loading indicator while fetching product data for selected categories, clear indication of selected tab.\n",
