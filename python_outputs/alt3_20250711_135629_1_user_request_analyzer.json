  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Create a new account, recover forgotten credentials.\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: \"Sign in\" button is the most prominent element, all form fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction, error messages have designated space, and sufficient padding exists between elements to prevent accidental taps.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: \"Welcome\" title, email field, password field, \"Sign in\" button.\nSupporting: \"Sign up\" button.\nContextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, empty fields), loading indicator during authentication, password recovery link (potentially hidden until needed).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Likely a single-column layout due to mobile constraints.  Vertical stacking of elements is recommended.\n* Components:  Title (H1 \"Welcome\"), Email input field (with appropriate keyboard type), Password input field (secure input type), \"Sign in\" button (primary action, prominent styling), \"Sign up\" button (text-only, secondary action).\n* Styling:  Clear visual hierarchy (title at top, input fields below, buttons at bottom).  Consider using platform-consistent styling guidelines for buttons and input fields.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Sign in.\nSecondary Actions: Sign up, password recovery (potentially contextually revealed).\nScreen States: Default (empty form), loading (authentication in progress), error (invalid credentials), success (redirect to account).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (potentially), clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, success confirmation (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n",
