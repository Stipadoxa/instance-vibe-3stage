Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain for mobile application
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications, requiring quick access to information updates
Platform Impact: Mobile users need concise information displays due to limited screen real estate; interactions are touch-based; the design must be easily scannable and understandable at a glance.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View recent notifications, access information within each notification
Secondary Goals: Mark notifications as read, potentially take actions based on notification content (depending on notification type,  this may be a future enhancement)
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, interruptions possible while viewing notifications
Ready for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed,  each with avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar
Supporting: Notification read/unread status indicator
Contextual:  Potentially additional information or actions depending on notification type (this is outside the scope of the current request).

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation bar at the bottom.
* Components: Top bar (User info, potentially a title such as "Notifications"), Notification item (User avatar, title, description, timestamp, read/unread indicator), Bottom navigation bar (with appropriate icons and labels).
* Styling:  Styling details are not specified in the user request and should be addressed in a separate design phase.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification item).
Secondary Actions:  None explicitly specified; potential future actions dependent on the notification types.
Screen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), potentially a "no notifications" state.
Feedback Needs: Clear visual indication of which notifications are read and unread.
