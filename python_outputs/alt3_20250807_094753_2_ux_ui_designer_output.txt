I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to naturally guide the user through the fields.  The email and password fields are stacked vertically, providing clear visual separation. The "Login" button is positioned below the input fields for easy access. The "Forgot password?" link is placed below the button for a logical flow.  All elements are given sufficient spacing for readability and visual breathing room.  The overall screen uses `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to ensure responsive behavior across different screen sizes.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward:  Enter email, enter password, click "Login".  The "Forgot password?" link provides an escape route for users who have forgotten their credentials.  This follows a standard and intuitive login pattern.

4. **Component Choices:**
    - I chose the `10:3907` (Button) component for the "Login" button because it offers a clear call to action, visually prominent, and consistent with the design system.  I considered using a `native-rectangle` styled as a button but chose the component for its inherent tappable behavior and styling consistency.
    - I chose the `10:8492` (text input) component for email and password fields, as it's specifically designed for this purpose and provides built-in features like placeholder text and secure input for passwords. I considered `native-text` elements but the input component offers better usability, especially on mobile.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks components for secure password masking.  To address this, I leveraged the built-in security features of the `10:8492` (text input) component, which offers a secure input type for password fields.


6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Visual hierarchy is established through vertical placement (top to bottom) and element size.  The headline text (if included) would have the highest prominence, followed by the input fields and the "Login" button.  The "Forgot password?" link has the least prominence due to its secondary nature.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**
    - For the "Login" button (`10:3907`), I've selected the `Size: "Medium"`, `Type: "Filled"`, `State: "Default"`, and `Color: "Green"` variants.  `Medium` size provides optimal tappable area on mobile devices, `Filled` offers better visual clarity, and `Green` is used for primary positive actions.
    - For the text input fields (`10:8492`), I selected `Type: "Filled"` for a clear visual container and `State: "enabled"` to ensure initial usability.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  No native elements are necessary because all functional requirements are met by components within the provided design system.
