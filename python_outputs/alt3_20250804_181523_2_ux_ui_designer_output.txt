I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure. The app bar occupies the top, followed by the search bar, filter button, and then the product grid.  The `itemSpacing` is set to 16 for visual breathing room between sections.  Product cards within the grid have a fixed width to create even columns and maintain a consistent visual grid. Full width is not needed for every item, allowing components to determine their own width unless specifically noted (such as the hero image if one existed).

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first sees the search results page with the search bar and filter button prominently displayed at the top for immediate interaction. Then, the product cards are presented in a visually appealing grid.

4. **Component Choices:** 
    * **AppBar:** `10:5620` (appbar) was chosen over using native elements because it provides a standardized top bar consistent with the design system.  
    * **Search Bar:** `10:12086` (search-field) provides a pre-built search component, eliminating the need for custom native input fields and search icon.
    * **Button:** `10:3907` (Button) is used for the Filter button, ensuring consistency with other buttons in the application. Native button implementation would lack the design system styling and theming.
    * **Product Card:** `147:3743` (product card) component is chosen to encapsulate the product information into a well-structured card view.  Customizing individual elements would not only be far more effort but likely inconsistent with the application's styling.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated grid layout component for presenting the product cards. I've addressed this gap using a `native-layoutContainer` with `layoutMode: "HORIZONTAL"` and `layoutWrap: "WRAP"`. The individual product cards (`147:3743`) are placed within this container. This workaround allows for responsive grid behavior without requiring a custom grid implementation.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  The visual hierarchy is established through:
    * **Top-down placement:**  The app bar and search bar are at the top, guiding the user’s attention.
    * **Larger font sizes:** Headlines and titles utilize larger font sizes for increased prominence.
    * **Spacing and padding:** Strategic use of spacing and padding guides the user’s eyes across the page.
    * **Color contrast:**  Colors are selected to create visual separation between different sections and components.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** The app bar uses the "search-field" type variant to match the functional requirement. The filter button uses the "Medium" size and "Filled" type variants of the `10:3907` (Button) component.

8. **Native Element Justification:** A `native-layoutContainer` is used to create the product grid layout, since the design system lacks a dedicated grid component. This is justified because a grid is a fundamental layout structure essential for displaying multiple similar items in a responsive manner.  The `layoutWrap: "WRAP"` property allows for flexible display across different screen sizes.
