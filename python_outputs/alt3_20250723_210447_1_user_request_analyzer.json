  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.\nUser Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in.  This includes users logging in for the first time and existing users.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a quick, secure, and touch-friendly login experience.  Screen real estate is limited, and users may be in distracting environments.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for faster access; reset forgotten passwords.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) meet minimum touch target sizes; error messages are clearly displayed; password recovery functionality is accessible; T&C footnote is clearly visible;  social login buttons function correctly.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, password recovery link.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google),  T&C footnote.\nContextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, network issues), loading indicator during authentication.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single-column layout optimized for mobile screens.  Fields stacked vertically.\n* Components:  Input fields (username/email, password), primary login button (prominent placement, clear visual hierarchy), social media login buttons (visually distinct from primary button), password recovery link (clear and easily accessible), footnote (small text, at the bottom).\n* Styling:  Follow visual style guide from provided reference imageâ€”use a clean and simple style with clear visual hierarchy and consistent spacing.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Log in using credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Log in using social media,  view T&C.\nScreen States: Default state (form is ready to receive input), loading state (during login attempt), error state (displaying appropriate messages), success state (redirect to app).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation of input fields, clear and concise error messages, visual feedback (e.g., loading indicator) during authentication process.\n\n",
