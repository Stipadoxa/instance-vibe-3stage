  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain focused on product display and purchase\nUser Type: Mobile shoppers browsing product listings\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need concise product information with large, clear touch targets; screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient layout.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase.\nSecondary Goals:  Compare similar products (implicitly), easily add to cart/wishlist (depending on design choices for the \"buy button\").\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for slow network connections impacting image loading.\nReady for handoff if: Image loads reliably, title, price, and \"buy\" button are clearly visible and have appropriately sized touch targets; text is legible at typical mobile viewing distances.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Product image, product title, product price, \"Buy\" button.\nSupporting:  Could include a rating (stars), brief description, availability indicator (in stock/out of stock).\nContextual: Loading indicator for image, \"added to cart\" confirmation, error messages (if applicable).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single-column layout optimized for mobile.  Consider a vertical layout to maximize space efficiency.\n* Components:  Image (primary visual element, possibly larger than other elements), Title (prominent text, below the image), Price (clearly displayed, ideally in a contrasting color), Buy button (prominently placed, clear call to action).\n* Styling: Use high-contrast colors for price and button to ensure legibility.  Button should follow platform-specific design guidelines (e.g., iOS or Android) for a consistent user experience.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  View product details, initiate purchase (\"Buy\" button).\nSecondary Actions:  (Potentially) Add to wishlist (a secondary action, if that function is included in the scope of the \"buy button\").\nScreen States: Default state (product details displayed), loading state (while image is loading), potential error state (if image fails to load or if there is a problem with price data).\nFeedback Needs:  Loading indicator for image, visual confirmation upon successful interaction with the \"Buy\" button.\n",
