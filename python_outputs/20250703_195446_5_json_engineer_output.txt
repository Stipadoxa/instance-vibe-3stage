Okay, I'm ready to translate UI Designer specifications into production-ready Figma plugin JSON.  Please provide the UI Designer specifications.  I will meticulously follow all the rules and guidelines you've provided, ensuring the resulting JSON is optimized for Figma plugin execution and adheres to best practices for auto-layout creation, padding management, icon handling, and text element sizing.  I will also leverage the provided scan data for accurate node names and component IDs.  I will explicitly state any assumptions I make during the translation process.
