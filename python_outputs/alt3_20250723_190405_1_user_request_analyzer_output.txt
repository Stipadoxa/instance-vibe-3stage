Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.
User Type: Mobile application users attempting to log in.  This includes both new and returning users.
Platform Impact: Mobile users require a streamlined, touch-friendly interface with clear visual hierarchy and minimal input.  Limited screen real estate necessitates concise design and efficient use of space.  Users may be in distracting environments, requiring a quick and easy authentication process.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Successfully authenticate and access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for quicker access; recover forgotten passwords; understand terms and conditions.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions, cognitive load minimized for intuitive interaction.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) are appropriately sized for touch interaction; all required content is visible and easily understood; error states are clearly displayed; visual hierarchy prioritizes the primary action (login button).

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, password recovery link.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), Terms & Conditions acceptance footnote.
Contextual: Error messages (incorrect credentials, network issues), loading indicator during authentication, success message upon successful login.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout for optimal mobile viewing.  Fields and buttons vertically stacked.
* Components:  
    * Username/email field: Single-line text input field.

Secondary Actions: Password recovery.
Screen States: Default state, loading state, error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirect to app).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation of username/email format and password length/complexity; clear, concise error messages; loading indicator during authentication; visual confirmation upon successful login (e.g., screen transition).
