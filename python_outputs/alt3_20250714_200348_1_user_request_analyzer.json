  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management\nUser Type: Mobile app users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive settings page with clear actions and touch-friendly interface.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of settings.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal and business account information, manage app preferences (notifications, chats, etc.), securely manage account access (password changes, logout).\nSecondary Goals: Understand the meaning of \"Verified ID\" badge, easily find and use help resources if needed.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, limited attention span.\nReady for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are included, using existing app components, top and bottom navigation bars are implemented, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (editable), Business details (editable), Access to Cars45 auction (toggle), \"Verified ID\" badge (with explanation), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats (toggle), Disable Feedback (toggle), Manage notifications, Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  Help/support links for any setting.\nContextual:  Success/failure messages after saving changes, loading indicators during actions (e.g., password change).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list of settings, similar to reference image, with top and bottom app navigation bars.  Each setting should be a tappable list item.\n* Components: Use existing app components for list items, toggles, and buttons.  Consider using a consistent design for all settings.\n* Styling: Adhere to the existing app's color scheme and style guide. Use visual cues for active/inactive toggles.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Navigate to each settings detail page (for those that require more detail), toggle settings (chats, feedback, Cars45 auction), initiate account deletion, logout.\nSecondary Actions: Access help/support for individual settings.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (for actions like saving changes), success/error states (for actions like password changes or account deletion).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback for toggles (on/off), confirmation messages upon successful changes, appropriate error messages for failed actions.\n\n",
