Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to access their accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, touch-friendly interface for authentication, dealing with potential distractions and varying network conditions.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of content.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for convenient access; recover forgotten passwords.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions, need for clear and concise information presentation.
Ready for handoff if:  All interactive elements (fields, buttons, links) have sufficient tap targets for mobile use; error messages are clearly displayed; password recovery and T&C acceptance are easily accessible.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (specify platforms), password recovery link.
Contextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, network issues), success message (upon successful login).  Footnote regarding T&C acceptance upon login.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical layout with fields above the primary button, followed by social login buttons, and finally the password recovery link and T&C footnote.
* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button ("Login" or similar), multiple secondary buttons (social media logins - specify which), hyperlink for password recovery, and a text footnote regarding T&C acceptance.
* Styling:  Consider mobile-friendly typography and spacing; ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.  Style should be consistent with the overall mobile app design language.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Login via social media accounts.
Screen States: Default state (login form displayed), loading state (during authentication), error state (invalid credentials, network error), success state (redirect to app content).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email/username format; clear and concise error messages; loading indicator during authentication; visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., redirect).
