I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to present information in a clear, top-to-bottom flow.  Each form element is given its own row within a container for proper spacing and alignment.  The "Forgot Password" link is placed below the form for accessibility.  The `itemSpacing` of the root container is set to 0 for seamless visual flow, while inner containers use `itemSpacing` to provide visual separation between elements.  Full-width input fields utilize `"horizontalSizing": "FILL"` to take up the available space.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward:  enter email, enter password, tap "Login".  The "Forgot Password" link provides a clear path for users who have forgotten their credentials.  The design prioritizes simplicity and ease of use to minimize user effort.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:8492` ("text input") component for the email and password fields because it's a standard, purpose-built component for this type of input. This was preferred over manually creating input fields with native elements, which would be more complex and less consistent with the design system.  I selected the `10:3907` ("Button") component for the "Login" button, again for design system consistency and optimal user experience and visual appeal over creating a button with native shapes.  There is no "link" component found in DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA. This is documented under Component Gaps.

5. **Component Gaps:** The user request requires a "link" component for the "Forgot Password" functionality, however no suitable component was found in the design system.  Therefore, I've implemented a workaround using a `native-text` element styled as a link. This provides the necessary functionality and user guidance while still maintaining overall design consistency.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through clear spacing, alignment, and the use of standard text styles, with "Login" being the prominent call to action at the bottom. 

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:3907` ("Button") component, I selected the `Size: "Medium"` and `State: "Default"` variants as these fit the visual context of a typical login button.  Alternatives like "Large" might make the button too dominant, while "Pressed" or "Hover" states are relevant only when the user interacts with the button.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  As stated above, the "Forgot Password" link's functionality cannot be achieved using any components present in the design system. Therefore, a `native-text` element has been employed to style the link.
