  "designRationale": {
    "mandatoryRequirementsImplementation": "The user's explicit requests for displaying the user's posts and a follow/unfollow button are implemented as core elements in the design.  The posts are displayed in a scrollable list, and the follow/unfollow button is clearly visible and interactive (using the 'Button' component).",
    "domainSafetyDecisions": "Given the social media context, several safety and trust elements are included:\n\n1. **Report User Profile:** A report button is added to allow users to report inappropriate profiles, promoting community safety.\n2. **Privacy Controls (Future Consideration):**  While full privacy controls are not included in this initial design due to complexity and space constraints (trade-off analysis below), this is documented as a future enhancement.",
    "enhancementSelection": "Several expected and valuable enhancements are included.  The 'expected' requirements, such as user profile picture, name, follower/following counts, and bio section, are considered standard social media design patterns, greatly enhancing the UX.  Engagement metrics (likes, comments) are also included for each post. Due to space and complexity constraints (trade-off analysis below),  highlighted posts, user activity status, direct messaging, and social media integration are deferred for future iterations.",
    "componentVerification": "All component IDs used in the design specification are verified against the provided DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA.  The 'Button' component is used for the follow/unfollow action. The 'list-item' component is used for displaying each post in the feed.",
    "layoutStrategy": "A mobile-first, single-column layout is employed.  The header section includes the user profile picture, name, bio, and follow/unfollow button.  The main content area consists of a vertically scrollable list of posts.",
    "userExperienceLogic": "The user flow is intuitive and straightforward. Users see the user profile information at the top, followed by their posts.  The follow/unfollow button allows for immediate interaction.  Navigation is simplified for mobile; more complex navigation would be added as future enhancements (trade-off analysis below).",
    "componentSelection": "'Button' component is used for the follow/unfollow functionality due to its built-in interactive capabilities and visual feedback.  'list-item' component is employed for posts due to its efficiency in displaying structured data. Variants used are documented in the JSON output.",
    "gapAnalysis": "The design system lacks a dedicated 'post' component suitable for displaying images/videos and engagement metrics. This gap is addressed using a combination of 'native-rectangle' for the image/video placeholder and 'native-text' for engagement metrics.  A more comprehensive post component would improve future iterations.",
    "tradeOffAnalysis": "Features like direct messaging, social media sharing, and highlighted posts are excluded in this version due to complexity and the need to prioritize essential elements and maintain a simple mobile experience.  These would increase complexity and potentially require custom component development, beyond the current design system capabilities. They are planned for future development.",
    "futureEnhancementOpportunities": "Future iterations could include:\n\n1.  Enhanced post component\n2.  Improved filtering and sorting of posts\n3.  Privacy controls\n4.  Direct messaging functionality\n5.  Social media sharing features\n6.  Highlighted/popular posts"
