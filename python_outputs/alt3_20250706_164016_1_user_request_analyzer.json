  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: General UI domain with interactive elements\nUser Type: Mobile users interacting with a simple button element.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users rely on touch interaction; the button must be large enough for easy tapping and visually distinct from the surrounding content.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Initiate an action by tapping the button.\nSecondary Goals:  Provide clear visual feedback upon interaction.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for accidental taps.\nReady for handoff if: The button has a minimum tappable area of 44 x 44 pixels (or adheres to platform guidelines), clear visual indication of its interactive nature (e.g., through styling and hover/pressed states), and sufficient contrast against the background.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Button label (text or icon) clearly indicating its function.\nSupporting:  None\nContextual:  Potentially loading indicator if the button initiates a lengthy process.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n\n* Layout:  Standalone button element.\n* Components:  Single button with label.\n* Styling:  Button should adhere to platform design guidelines for mobile.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Tap the button to trigger the intended action.\nSecondary Actions: None (for a simple button).\nScreen States: Default (untapped), Pressed (tapped), Potentially Disabled (if applicable).\nFeedback Needs:  Visual feedback upon tap (e.g., change in color, shape, or a brief animation).\n",
