  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure. The hero section (image gallery) occupies full width at the top, establishing visual prominence for the product.  The following sections (title, price, description, seller info, and contact button) are arranged vertically with consistent 16pt spacing for readability and visual breathing room. Full-width elements (`native-text`) are used for the title, price, and description to maximize screen real estate.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow prioritizes information hierarchy: product images first, followed by key details (title, price), then supporting information (description, seller details), and finally, a clear call to action (\"Contact Seller\").  This sequential layout guides the user naturally through essential information.\n\n4. **Component Choices:**\n    * **IMAGES:**  The design system lacks a dedicated image gallery component. Therefore, `native-rectangle` with image fills is used for the gallery, leveraging its horizontalSizing: \"FILL\" for full-width display and enabling easy handling of multiple images within a scrollable container. I considered using multiple individual image components, but a gallery is inherently better for displaying multiple images on a product page. \n    * **Button:** The `10:3907` (Button) component is used for the \"Contact Seller\" button due to its clear visual design and ease of integration. It is selected in the \"Green\" color to highlight its significance as the primary action.  Alternatives considered were leaving this to native elements but using a pre-built button adds to the visual cohesiveness with the design system.\n    * **Text:** `native-text` elements are used for the title, price, condition, and description to leverage the design system's typographic styles while ensuring full-width display. Alternatives such as using a generic text-body component would not have fulfilled the full-width requirement needed for the design.\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks several components needed for a fully compliant product page, such as an image gallery, seller rating component, and a comprehensive product details layout. To address these gaps, I utilized a combination of native elements (like `native-rectangle` for image placeholders and `native-text` for detailed information blocks), and existing components such as the button, filling any gaps while adhering to the design system's principles as much as possible. This allows to meet the users' needs while not creating artificial components or guessing missing component IDs.  The native elements are used solely for functionality, not aesthetic embellishment.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Visual hierarchy is established through size and position. The hero section (gallery) has the most significant visual weight due to its large size and placement at the top.  The title and price are next in visual prominence, followed by the description, seller information, and finally the button. Consistent spacing aids visual flow and readability.\n\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  Variants are chosen for optimal user experience within their respective components. For example, button \"Green\" color enhances clarity of this call to action. Text style variants for titles, labels, and body text ensure appropriate semantic and visual hierarchy throughout the design.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:**  Native elements are used to address the lack of a gallery component (`native-rectangle` for image placeholders) and to provide full-width text elements (`native-text`) for the product description, enabling dynamic content length handling.  This is necessary because it is unlikely a design system would accommodate all of the possible variations in image sizes or description length that would be encountered on this particular page.\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Product Detail Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 0,\n    \"paddingTop\": 0,\n    \"paddingBottom\": 0,\n    \"paddingLeft\": 0,\n    \"paddingRight\": 0,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"name\": \"Hero Section\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 0,\n        \"paddingTop\": 0,\n        \"paddingBottom\": 0,\n        \"paddingLeft\": 0,\n        \"paddingRight\": 0,\n        \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n        \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n            \"name\": \"Image Gallery\",\n            \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n            \"itemSpacing\": 8,\n            \"paddingTop\": 16,\n            \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n            \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n            \"paddingRight\": 16,\n            \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n            \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n            \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\",\n            \"items\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"native-rectangle\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                  \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\",\n                  \"height\": 200,\n                  \"cornerRadius\": 8,\n                  \"fill\": {\n                    \"type\": \"IMAGE\",\n                    \"scaleMode\": \"FILL\"\n                  }\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"native-rectangle\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                  \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\",\n                  \"height\": 200,\n                  \"cornerRadius\": 8,\n                  \"fill\": {\n                    \"type\": \"IMAGE\",\n                    \"scaleMode\": \"FILL\"\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"name\": \"Content Section\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n        \"paddingTop\": 16,\n        \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n        \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n        \"paddingRight\": 16,\n        \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n        \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"native-text\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"content\": \"2023 MacBook Pro 16\\\"\",\n              \"textStyle\": \"Title/Large\",\n              \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"native-text\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"content\": \"$1200\",\n              \"textStyle\": \"Title/Medium\",\n              \"color\": \"Primary/primary50\",\n              \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"native-text\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"content\": \"Good Condition\",\n              \"textStyle\": \"Label/Medium\",\n              \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"native-text\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"content\": \"Description of the used laptop.
