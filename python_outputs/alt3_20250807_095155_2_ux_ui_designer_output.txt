I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.


**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to present information in a clear, top-to-bottom flow.  Each input field and button occupies its own row, with consistent spacing (16px padding, 8px between elements). The "Forgot Password?" link is placed below the login button for clear visual association and accessibility. All elements use `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to ensure they span the full width of the screen.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward: the user enters their email and password, clicks the "Login" button, and if they forget their password, they can click the link for password recovery. This follows standard login screen conventions for ease of use.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:8492` ("text input") component for email and password fields because it provides built-in placeholder text, clear visual feedback on focus and error, and the design system already defines appropriate styling.  I considered using a `native-text` element with manual styling, but the existing component offers superior usability and consistency within the design system.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "Login" button component that fully satisfies the request for a filled green button with a specific action label. As a workaround, I use the `10:3907` ("Button") component with the `Color: "Green"`, `Size: "Medium"`, `Type: "Filled"`, and `State: "Default"` variants. This workaround offers the functionality while adhering to existing button style.


6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through vertical spacing and element sizing. The input fields are larger and more prominent than the button and link.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** I selected the "Medium" size for the button because it provides an adequate touch target on mobile devices while maintaining a balance with the input fields. I chose the "Filled" button type because it is the most visually prominent and readily identifiable as an action element. The "Default" button state conveys the initial, un-interacted-with status. For input components, the "enabled" state and the "Filled" type were chosen for a visually appealing and intuitive feel.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  The requirement for password input masking cannot be directly implemented using components from the design system. Therefore, I use the "type": "native-text" element. This workaround provides the essential functionality, which is crucial for the security of user credentials, while maintaining a consistent visual design with the other inputs.  The "Forgot Password?" link is also created using a "native-text" element styled as a link, as there are no readily available link component in the provided design system.
