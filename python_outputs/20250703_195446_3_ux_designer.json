  "content": "## Information Architecture Specification:  [Feature Name:  Example - Product Catalog]\n\n**Screen Architecture**\n\n**Layout Structure:**\n* **Screen Pattern:** Hub-and-spoke (Main category screen leading to product detail screens)\n* **Navigation Flow:** List-based browsing (Categories, then product listings within each category)\n* **Content Organization:** Fixed header (search, filter), scrollable content (product list), fixed footer (cart/navigation)\n\n**Mobile Framework:**\n* **Primary Interactions:** Tap to select product, swipe to navigate between product images, tap to add to cart.\n* **Content Prioritization:** Product image, title, price are immediately visible.  Description, reviews, and additional details are discoverable via scrolling.\n* **Action Accessibility:** Add-to-cart button in the bottom right of each product listing, within thumb zone.\n\n**Content Requirements**\n\n**1. Product Listing [Priority: Critical]**\n\n**Content Structure:**\n* **Primary Content:** Product title, main image\n* **Secondary Content:** Price, short description\n* **Metadata:** Stock level (e.g., \"In stock,\" \"Low stock\"), rating (star rating)\n* **Interactive Elements:** Tap product image to expand, tap title for detail view, tap add-to-cart button.\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n* **Display Capability:** Scrollable list, image display, status indication (stock level), price display.\n* **Interaction Patterns:** Tap to navigate, tap to add to cart.\n* **Content Adaptation:** Image sizes adapt to screen size, title truncates with \"more\" if needed, description truncated with \"more\".\n\n**Implementation Options:**\n* **Primary Approach:** List item with leading image, title, and trailing price & add-to-cart button.\n* **Alternative Approaches:** Card with image, title, price, and add-to-cart button; grid layout of product images.\n* **Content Mapping:** Title ↦ `text`, Price ↦ `supporting-text`, Stock level ↦ `trailing-text` (or badge), Image ↦ `leading-image`.\n* **Mobile Considerations:** Ensure image is appropriately sized for tap target; add-to-cart button positioned within thumb zone.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** product, list, item, image, price, status, cart, add-to-cart\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\n* **Design System Priority:** High\n* **If High:**  Prioritize design system components.  If no exact match, select closest visual variant.\n* **If Medium:** Prefer design system, fallback to native `ImageView`, `TextView`, and buttons for non-interactive elements.\n* **If Low:** Native elements are acceptable if no suitable design system components exist.\n\n**Fallback Guidance:** Use native `ImageView`, `TextView`, and `Button` components where necessary.\n\n\n**2. Product Detail [Priority: High]**\n\n**Content Structure:**\n* **Primary Content:** Product title, large hero image, detailed description.\n* **Secondary Content:**  Specifications, reviews, customer questions & answers.\n* **Metadata:** SKU, price, availability\n* **Interactive Elements:** Tap image to zoom, tap reviews to expand, tap Q&A to expand.\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n* **Display Capability:** Scrollable view, image gallery, expandable sections, input field (for questions).\n* **Interaction Patterns:** Tap to expand/collapse sections, tap to add to cart, swipe to navigate images.\n* **Content Adaptation:** Text adapts to screen size, images scale appropriately.\n\n\n**Implementation Options:**\n* **Primary Approach:** Scrollable view with sections (header, images, description, specs, reviews, Q&A).\n* **Alternative Approaches:** Accordion-style collapsible sections.\n* **Content Mapping:** Title ↦ `heading`, Description ↦ `body-text`, Price ↦ `price-display`, Image ↦ `image-gallery`.\n* **Mobile Considerations:** Ensure touch targets are large enough for easy interaction.  Prioritize information based on importance and thumb-zone accessibility.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** product, detail, image, gallery, description, specifications, review, question, answer\n\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\n* **Design System Priority:** Medium\n* **If High/Medium:** Prioritize design system components. Use native elements if necessary (TextView, ImageView).\n* **If Low:** Native elements are acceptable (e.g., `ScrollView`, `ImageView`, `TextView`).\n\n**Fallback Guidance:** Native elements are suitable for basic display functions if design system lacks specific components.\n\n\n**3. Shopping Cart [Priority: High]**\n\n**Content Structure:**\n* **Primary Content:** List of added products, total price\n* **Secondary Content:** Item quantity, individual item price.\n* **Metadata:** Order summary (subtotal, tax, shipping)\n* **Interactive Elements:** Tap item to remove, adjust quantity, proceed to checkout.\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n* **Display Capability:** Scrollable list of items, total price display, editing capability.\n* **Interaction Patterns:** Tap to remove, adjust quantity via +/- buttons.\n* **Content Adaptation:** Item details adapt to screen size, total is always visible.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\n* **Primary Approach:** List of items, each with image, title, quantity, price, remove button.\n* **Alternative Approaches:** Table view with product information and actions.\n* **Content Mapping:** Product Name ↦ `text`, Quantity ↦ `numeric-input`, Price ↦ `supporting-text`, Remove ↦ `trailing-icon-button` .\n* **Mobile Considerations:** Ensure buttons are large enough, total price is prominently displayed.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** cart, item, quantity, price, total, remove, checkout\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\n* **Design System Priority:** High\n* **If High/Medium:** Use design system components. Fallback to native list items with native edit capabilities.\n* **If Low:** Native table view.\n\n**Fallback Guidance:** Native table view with custom cells can be used if necessary\n\n\n**Navigation Architecture**\n\n**Inter-Section Navigation:**\n* **Flow Pattern:** Linear flow (Categories ↦ Product Listing ↦ Product Detail ↦ Cart ↦ Checkout)\n* **Entry Mechanisms:** Direct links from home screen to categories, search for products.\n* **Context Preservation:**  Back button maintains navigation context.\n\n**Intra-Section Navigation:**\n* **Content Discovery:** Filtering and sorting options for product listings. Search functionality for specific products.\n* **Task Completion:**  Adding products to cart, proceeding to checkout.\n\n\n**Implementation Guidance**\n\nSee \"Implementation Options\" within each Content Requirement section.\n\n\n**Mobile Optimization Patterns:**\n\n* **Touch Target Requirements:** Minimum 48px for interactive elements, 56px for primary actions.\n* **Thumb Navigation Zones:** Bottom third of screen for primary actions, top half for secondary navigation.\n* **Content Scaling:** Images should scale responsively, text should adapt to screen size,  using appropriate text sizes.\n\n\n**Design System Flexibility:** See \"Component Fallback Strategy\" within each Content Requirement section.\n\n\n**Success Validation**\n\n* **User Task Completion:** Users can efficiently browse, select, and add products to their cart.\n* **Information hierarchy:** Clear visual hierarchy guides users through product information.\n* **Navigation:**  Intuitive navigation between categories, product listings, and detail views.\n* **Implementation Flexibility:**  The IA specification is adaptable to various design systems and components.\n\n\nThis specification prioritizes content structure and functional requirements, enabling flexible implementation across different design systems while maintaining a consistent and user-friendly experience.  Specific component names are avoided to maximize adaptability.\n",
