  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates efficient form design.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (e.g., social login, biometric authentication if appropriate).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential for typos due to touch keyboard.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is the most prominent element, password recovery link is clearly visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction, error messages are displayed clearly with suggested resolutions, and sufficient spacing is provided for comfortable touch interaction.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button.\nSupporting: Password recovery link, \"Remember me\" checkbox,  social login options (if applicable).\nContextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, empty fields), loading indicator during authentication, security notices (e.g., https indication).\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials.\nSecondary Actions: Initiate password recovery, access account creation (if applicable), social login (if applicable).\nScreen States: Default state (empty form), loading state (while authenticating), error state (incorrect credentials), success state (redirects to the appropriate screen).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (optional, but recommended), clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, and visual cues to indicate successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n",
