I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs referenced below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical `layoutContainer` as the root, providing a clear top-to-bottom flow for the notification settings.  Each notification setting is presented as a separate list item within a vertical container, creating visual grouping and clear separation between options.  The `itemSpacing` is set to 8px to provide visual breathing room without excessive spacing.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flows from top to bottom, easily toggling each notification type on or off using the switch components.  Clear labels provide context for each setting.  The design prioritizes simplicity and ease of understanding.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:9912` (switch) component for the toggles because it's a standard, readily understandable UI element for boolean settings.  I considered using custom native toggle switches (not allowed) and other components. This was ideal due to its built-in accessibility features.  For the overall layout, using `10:10214` (list-item) provides a clean, consistent presentation for each notification option.  I considered using a `native-grid` (forbidden), but the vertical list is better suited to manage a potentially growing list of notification settings.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a unified list-item component that directly integrates toggle switches, requiring the list items to have a switch within. This workaround allows to meet the functional requirement while adhering to the design system, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the use of clear section headers and consistent spacing between list items.  The labels for each notification type are prominently displayed using a clear primary text style. The switch components act as clear secondary visual cues for each notification status.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the switch component (`10:9912`), I selected the `State: "enabled"` variant consistently as all the switch components are meant to be interactable. I considered adding "State: hover, pressed" but as it adds to the complexity of design specs without any benefit it is omitted. The same rationale applies to "Selected" variant which is being omitted for the sake of simplicity. For `10:10214`  (list-item), I selected "Leading: Switch" variant to directly integrate the toggle into the list item. Other leading options (Checkbox, Icon, Image, None, Radio Button) were not as suitable for a simple on/off setting.

8. **Native Element Justification:** None.  All design requirements were met using existing components from the design system.
