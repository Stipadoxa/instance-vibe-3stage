Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display of information, prioritization of essential content due to limited screen real estate, and consideration for touch interactions.  Notifications should be easily scannable and actionable.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals:  Quickly assess the importance of each notification, potentially take action based on notification content (though specific actions aren't detailed in the request).
User Constraints: Limited screen size on mobile, touch-based interaction, potential for distractions while viewing notifications.
Ready for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction and easily legible.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar.
Supporting:  None specified in the request.
Contextual:  Potentially a counter indicating unread notifications (though not explicitly mentioned).

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.
* Components:  Top bar (containing user info), Notification Item (repeating component with user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation (5 tabs).
* Styling:  No specific styling requirements are mentioned in the request.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (implied, not explicitly stated).
Secondary Actions:  None explicitly specified in the request (potential actions would depend on the notification type).
Screen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications).  Potentially additional states for loading, no notifications, or error conditions (though not detailed in the request).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications (implied).
