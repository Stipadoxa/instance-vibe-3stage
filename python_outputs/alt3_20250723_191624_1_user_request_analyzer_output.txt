Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in to their accounts.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, touch-friendly login screen that minimizes input and leverages familiar social login options.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of essential information.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media logins for faster access; recover lost credentials.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for distractions, reliance on mobile network connectivity.
Ready for handoff if:  All fields are appropriately sized for touch interaction, error messages are clearly displayed, and all interactive elements (buttons and links) meet minimum tappable area guidelines.  Password recovery and Terms & Conditions are clearly linked.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), "Forgot Password" link.
Contextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication.  Terms & Conditions acceptance footnote.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical layout with input fields stacked above the primary login button, followed by social login buttons and then the password recovery link and T&C footnote.
* Components:  Input fields (username/email, password) with appropriate keyboard types; Primary button ("Log In"); Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google icons); "Forgot Password?" link; Footnote indicating acceptance of T&C.
* Styling:  Consistent with the visual style of the provided reference image (clean, light background, clear text hierarchy, appropriate spacing).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Log in with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Log in via social media accounts.
Screen States: Default (input fields visible), Loading (indicator displayed), Error (error message displayed), Success (transition to app main screen).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation feedback on input fields (e.g., email format validation), clear error messages for login failures, visual feedback during authentication (loading indicator).
