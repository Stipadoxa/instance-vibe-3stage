  "content": "User Request: \"Manage subscriptions\"\nPlatform: Desktop\n\n\n**Domain & Context**\n\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain, likely involving recurring billing and user account management.\nUser Type:  Desktop users managing their active subscriptions for a service, likely requiring detailed information and control.\nPlatform Impact: Desktop users expect detailed information, complex interactions, and efficient management of multiple subscriptions.  The larger screen real estate allows for more complex layouts and detailed data presentation compared to mobile.\n\n\n**User Requirements**\n\nPrimary Goals: View active subscriptions, cancel or modify subscriptions.\nSecondary Goals:  View billing history for each subscription, update payment information, download invoices.\n\nUser Constraints: Users may manage multiple subscriptions, requiring efficient navigation and filtering.  They may need to understand the implications of cancelling or modifying subscriptions (e.g., data loss, service interruption).\n\n\nReady for handoff if:  All active subscriptions are clearly displayed in a list format, with key information (name, status, billing date, cost) immediately visible.  Cancel/modify actions are clearly labelled and require confirmation.  A clear and concise billing history is accessible for each subscription.\n\n\n**Content Requirements**\n\nCritical: List of active subscriptions with status (active, cancelled, paused), subscription name, billing date, cost, and action buttons (cancel, modify).\nSupporting: Billing history for each subscription (dates, amounts, descriptions), payment method information, download invoice option.\nContextual:  Clear indication of upcoming renewal dates, tooltips explaining subscription details, help/support links for billing questions.\n\n\n**Screen Requirements**\n\nPrimary Actions:  Cancel subscription, modify subscription details.\nSecondary Actions: View billing history, update payment information, download invoice.\nScreen States: Default (list of subscriptions), loading state (fetching data), empty state (no active subscriptions), error state (data fetch failure).\n\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of successful actions (cancellation, modification), confirmation dialogs before irreversible actions, loading indicators during data retrieval, informative error messages.\n",
