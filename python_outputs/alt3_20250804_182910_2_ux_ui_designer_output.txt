**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The profile page uses a vertical layout (`layoutMode`: "VERTICAL").  The top section contains the user's profile picture (using an avatar component) and name, arranged horizontally. Below this, the email address is displayed followed by a horizontal divider (`10:8459`). The order history is presented as a list using the `10:10214` list item component. Each order in the list displays relevant details such as date, items, and total. Finally, an "Edit Profile" button (`10:3907`), styled as a primary button is placed at the bottom.  Consistent spacing of 16 pixels is used between sections. Full-width elements utilize `"horizontalSizing": "FILL"` where appropriate (not applicable for all components).

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward. Users see their profile information at a glance. The "Edit Profile" button leads to a separate screen to modify the details, enabling a clean and focused experience on this primary view.

4. **Component Choices:**
    * **Avatar:** I chose `10:7773` (avatar / big) over `10:7798` (avatar / single) and `24:10352` (avatar  / stack) because it allows for a larger profile picture, consistent with typical user profile pages. The `Photo` variant is set to "Yes".
    * **List Item:** I chose `10:10214` (List item) for the order history because it provides a structured way to display multiple orders with headline (order summary) and supporting text (details) sections.  Variants used are tailored to present two lines of information (Condition: "2-line")
    * **Button:** I chose `10:3907` (Button) for "Edit Profile" because it is a clear and universally understood call to action. The `Type` variant is set to "Filled" and the `Size` variant to "Medium", and `Color` to "Green"  for visual prominence.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying user profile information holistically. Therefore, I combined existing components (`10:7773`, `10:10214`, `10:3907`, `native-text`) to achieve this functionality. This approach maintains a consistent visual style while effectively presenting the required information.  A dedicated Order History component would have been ideal, however, this current solution allows for expansion and better customization.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Visual hierarchy is established through size and placement. The name and avatar are prominent at the top.  The email address follows, then the order history is separated by a divider to enhance visual distinction. The "Edit Profile" button is placed at the bottom, and is colored green, improving it's visual prominence.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  Variant choices are detailed in section 4.  These selections ensure clarity, consistency and appropriate size for mobile and desktop layouts.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  `native-text` elements were utilized to display the user's name and email address. While a text component might seem appropriate, the direct use of `native-text` allows for precise control over text style to ensure it is visually distinct and prominent on the screen without needing to introduce additional components.
