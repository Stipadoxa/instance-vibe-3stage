  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management\nUser Type: Mobile app users managing their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive interface with clear navigation and touch-friendly controls.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of settings.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage notifications, and securely log out.\nSecondary Goals:  View account status information (e.g., \"Verified ID\" badge), access help resources (\"What is it?\"), easily change key account details.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, need for clear visual hierarchy to quickly locate desired settings.\nReady for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are implemented using the provided design system components, navigation is intuitive, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.  Important settings are easily accessible.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Personal details section, business details section, notification management settings, change password, log out.\nSupporting: Change phone number, change email, change language, disable chats, disable feedback, \"Verified ID\" badge status and explanation.\nContextual:  Status indicators (e.g., \"Active\" for Cars45 auction access), help text (\"What is it?\").\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single column list of settings, similar to the reference image, using the provided design system components for list items.  Header includes back navigation and \"Settings\" title.  Each setting should use a consistent design component with clear visual hierarchy.  Consider using dividers to visually separate sections.\n* Components:  Use standard list items from the provided design system. Each list item should include a clear setting label and, where appropriate, supplementary information (status indicators, help text, navigation indicators).\n* Styling:  Refer to the provided design system and reference image for color palette, typography, and overall visual style.  Maintain consistency with the existing app's design language.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Navigate to specific setting pages, save changes, log out.\nSecondary Actions: Access help information (\"What is it?\").\nScreen States: Default state (all settings displayed), potentially loading state if settings are dynamically fetched, success states after saving changes, and error states for input validation or network issues.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on changes saved, loading indicators during data retrieval or saving, error messages for invalid input or failure to save changes.\n",
