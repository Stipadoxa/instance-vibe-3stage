Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in.  This includes users logging in for the first time and existing users.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a quick, secure, and touch-friendly login experience.  Screen real estate is limited, and users may be in distracting environments.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for faster access; reset forgotten passwords.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) meet minimum touch target sizes; error messages are clearly displayed; password recovery functionality is accessible; T&C footnote is clearly visible;  social login buttons function correctly.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, password recovery link.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google),  T&C footnote.
Contextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, network issues), loading indicator during authentication.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single-column layout optimized for mobile screens.  Fields stacked vertically.
* Components:  Input fields (username/email, password), primary login button (prominent placement, clear visual hierarchy), social media login buttons (visually distinct from primary button), password recovery link (clear and easily accessible), footnote (small text, at the bottom).
* Styling:  Follow visual style guide from provided reference imageâ€”use a clean and simple style with clear visual hierarchy and consistent spacing.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Log in using credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Log in using social media,  view T&C.
Screen States: Default state (form is ready to receive input), loading state (during login attempt), error state (displaying appropriate messages), success state (redirect to app).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation of input fields, clear and concise error messages, visual feedback (e.g., loading indicator) during authentication process.
