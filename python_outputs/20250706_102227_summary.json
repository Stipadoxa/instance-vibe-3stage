      "content": "Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Product Search Results Page\n\n**Domain Analysis**\n\nPrimary Domain: E-commerce  Confidence Level: High (90%+)\nKey Evidence: \"product cards,\" \"search results page,\" \"filters\" are all strongly associated with e-commerce product browsing and filtering functionalities.  The request explicitly mentions \"product\" multiple times.\nAlternative Domains Considered: None. The terms used are directly indicative of an e-commerce context.  The request lacks any characteristics of other domains like finance (\"transactions,\" \"payments\"), healthcare (\"patient records\"), or education (\"courses,\" \"assignments\").\nValidation Check: The evidence strongly supports an e-commerce domain. The absence of keywords or context associated with other domains further solidifies this classification.\n\n\n**User Profile**\n\nPrimary Users:\n* Online Shoppers:  Individuals browsing and purchasing products online. Demographics will vary greatly depending on the specific product category (e.g., age, income, tech savviness).\n* Returning Customers: Existing users familiar with the site who are looking for specific products or categories.\n* First-time Visitors: New users exploring the website for the first time.\n\nUsage Context:\n* When:  Throughout the day, at any time convenient to the shopper.\n* Where:  On various devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone) in various locations (home, work, commute).\n* How:  Users will navigate to the search results page after entering search terms.  They will then interact with filters and browse product cards to find desired products.\n\nEnvironment:\n* Devices:  Responsive design is needed for desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n* Location:  Various - home, office, mobile.  Connectivity may be inconsistent.\n* Interruptions:  Users might be interrupted by other tasks or notifications.\n* Constraints:  Users may have limited time and attention spans.  Poor internet connectivity can negatively impact page load times.\n\nPrimary Goals:\n* Efficiently find desired products that match their search criteria.\n* Quickly compare and evaluate different products based on displayed information.\n* Proceed to the product page to learn more and ultimately purchase.\n\n\n**Core Use Cases**\n\n1. **Targeted Product Search:** A user searches for \"blue running shoes\" and uses the filters (size, brand) to narrow down the results, viewing product cards to compare options.\n\n2. **Filtering by Category and Price:** A user searches for \"headphones\" and uses the filters (price range, type) to quickly identify headphones within a specific budget and category.\n\n3. **Browsing Related Products:** After viewing a specific product card, a user explores other related products shown in the results.\n\n4. **Refining Search Results:** A user initially searches for \"dress shirts,\" gets too many results, and uses filters (color, size, brand) to refine the search and improve the relevance of results.\n\n5. **Handling No Results:** The user searches for a highly specific item and receives a \"No Results Found\" message with suggestions for alternative searches or related items.\n\n6. **Mobile Search:** A user uses their phone to search for a product during their lunch break, quickly evaluating a few product cards before committing to visit a product page.\n\n\n**Functional Requirements**\n\n1. **Search Functionality (Priority: Critical)**\n    * Purpose: Enables users to find desired products quickly.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Keyword-based search, auto-suggestions, search history, handling of typos and misspellings.\n    * Data Requirements:  Product catalog data (name, description, price, images, etc.), search index.\n    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the product catalog database and potentially a search engine API (e.g., Elasticsearch).\n\n\n2. **Filtering Functionality (Priority: High)**\n    * Purpose: Allows users to refine search results based on specific criteria.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Three horizontal filters (pre-defined, customizable),  dynamic update of results based on filter selections, clear filter selections.\n    * Data Requirements:  Product attribute data (e.g., size, color, brand, price range).\n    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the product catalog database.\n\n\n3. **Product Card Display (Priority: High)**\n    * Purpose: Presents concise information about products to aid in comparison.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Display of product image, name, price, short description.  \"Add to Cart\" functionality for each product.\n    * Data Requirements:  Product data (image URLs, names, prices, descriptions).\n    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the shopping cart system and product detail pages.\n\n\n4. **Pagination/Sorting (Priority: Medium)**\n    * Purpose: Enables efficient browsing of large result sets.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Pagination of search results, sorting options (e.g., price, relevance).\n    * Data Requirements:  Number of results, current page, sorting criteria.\n    * Integration Needs: None.\n\n\n5. **Error Handling (Priority: High)**\n    * Purpose: Gracefully handles unexpected situations.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Handle invalid searches, no results found messages, connection errors.\n    * Data Requirements:  Error messages and related data.\n    * Integration Needs: None.\n\n\n**Business Requirements**\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n* Increased conversion rates (products added to cart/purchases)\n* Improved average order value (AOV)\n* Reduced bounce rate from search results page\n* Increased search query volume\n* Improved customer satisfaction scores (CSAT)\n\nPerformance Targets:\n* Search results should load within 1 second.\n* Filter updates should be near-instantaneous.\n* Page load time should be under 3 seconds.\n* 99.9% uptime.\n\nCompliance:  PCI DSS compliance (if handling payment information directly on the page), GDPR compliance (if collecting user data).\n\n\n**User Experience Requirements**\n\nInformation Priority:  Product name, image, price should be most prominent.  Filter options and sorting should be clearly visible.\nInteraction Patterns:  Intuitive filtering mechanisms (dropdown menus, checkboxes), clear visual feedback on filter selections, smooth pagination.\nPlatform Constraints:  Responsive design for various screen sizes, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).\n\n\nThis PRD provides a comprehensive outline for the development of the enhanced search results page, minimizing ambiguity and allowing for efficient collaboration between product, design, and engineering teams.\n",

      "content": "## Information Architecture Specification:  My Awesome Mobile App\n\nThis specification outlines the information architecture for \"My Awesome Mobile App,\" focusing on content structure and functional requirements, independent of any specific design system.  The goal is to provide a flexible framework adaptable to Material Design, iOS Human Interface Guidelines, or custom design systems.\n\n**Screen Architecture**\n\n**Layout Structure:**\nScreen Pattern: Hub-and-Spoke (central hub screen with links to other features)\nNavigation Flow: Tab-based sections (bottom navigation bar)\nContent Organization: Fixed header + scrollable content\n\n**Mobile Framework:**\nPrimary Interactions: Touch-based, tap interactions, swipe gestures for navigation where appropriate.  Thumb zone priority for primary actions in the bottom third of the screen.\nContent Prioritization:  Critical information (e.g., account balance, urgent notifications) at the top of the screen.  Less critical information revealed through scrolling.\nAction Accessibility: Primary actions are placed within the thumb zone.  Secondary actions are accessible but not prioritized.\n\n\n**Content Requirements**\n\n**1. Account Overview (Priority: Critical)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Account balance, user name, profile picture\nSecondary Content: Recent transactions summary, available credit\nMetadata: Last updated timestamp\nInteractive Elements: Tap profile picture to edit profile, tap transaction summary to view details\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Fixed header, scrollable content, status indication (e.g., low balance warning)\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, swipe to refresh\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for details, single-line for balance.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: Card with header (profile picture and name), body (balance, summary), and trailing metadata (timestamp).\nAlternative Approaches:  List with separate sections for balance, summary, and metadata.\nContent Mapping: Title  \"header text\", Balance  \"primary text\", Summary  \"supporting text\", Timestamp  \"metadata text\"\nMobile Considerations: Large, clear display of balance; sufficient touch target for profile picture.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** account, balance, profile, transaction, status\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: High\nFallback Guidance: If a card component isn't available, use a combination of native text views and image views to achieve a similar layout.\n\n\n**2. Transactions (Priority: High)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Transaction date, description, amount\nSecondary Content: Transaction type (debit/credit), merchant (if applicable)\nMetadata: None\nInteractive Elements: Tap a transaction to view details\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Scrollable list, filtering options (date range, type)\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, pull-to-refresh\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for description, single-line for date, amount, type.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: List item with leading element (date), primary text (description), and trailing text (amount).\nAlternative Approaches: Card list, table view.\nContent Mapping: Date  \"leading text\", Description  \"primary text\", Amount  \"trailing text\"\nMobile Considerations:  Clear visual separation between transactions; efficient scrolling behavior.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** transaction, list, item, date, amount, filter\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: Medium\nFallback Guidance:  If a standard list item isn't available, a native table view can be used.\n\n\n**3. Settings (Priority: Medium)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Setting name (e.g., Notifications, Security)\nSecondary Content: Brief description of each setting\nMetadata: On/Off switch or other status indicator (where applicable)\nInteractive Elements: Tap a setting to configure it\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Scrollable list, on/off switches, segmented controls (if needed)\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, toggle switches\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for descriptions, single-line for setting names.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: List item with leading text (setting name), trailing text (brief description), and trailing switch/indicator.\nAlternative Approaches:  Simple card list, segmented controls for certain settings.\nContent Mapping:  Name  \"primary text\", Description  \"secondary text\", Status  \"trailing switch\"\nMobile Considerations:  Clearly labeled settings; sufficient space for toggles and descriptions.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** settings, list, item, switch, toggle, configuration\n\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: Medium\nFallback Guidance: If design system switches are unavailable, native switch controls may be used.\n\n\n**4. Notifications (Priority: High)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Notification message\nSecondary Content: Timestamp, sender (if applicable)\nMetadata: Read/Unread status\nInteractive Elements: Tap notification to view details, swipe to dismiss\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Scrollable list, status indication (read/unread), swipe actions.\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, swipe to dismiss\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for message, single-line for timestamp and sender.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: List item with leading icon (read/unread), primary text (message), and trailing text (timestamp).\nAlternative Approaches:  Card-based notifications\nContent Mapping: Message  \"primary text\", Timestamp  \"secondary text\", Read status  \"leading icon\"\nMobile Considerations:  Clear visual cues for unread notifications; efficient swipe-to-dismiss.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** notification, message, list, item, status, unread\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: Medium\nFallback Guidance: If a specialized notification component is unavailable, use a standard list item with appropriate styling.\n\n\n\n**Navigation Architecture**\n\n**Inter-Section Navigation:**\nFlow Pattern: Bottom navigation bar for easy switching between sections.\nEntry Mechanisms:  Tab bar at the bottom of the screen.\nContext Preservation:  Context is generally not preserved between sections; each section functions independently.\n\n\n**Intra-Section Navigation:**\nContent Discovery:  Scrolling, filtering (where applicable).\nTask Completion:  Primary actions are clearly indicated within each section.\n\n\n**Implementation Guidance**\n\n**Content-to-Component Mapping:**\n(Examples provided above in each functional area)\n\n\n**Mobile Optimization Patterns:**\nTouch Target Requirements: Minimum 44px for interactive elements, larger for primary actions (e.g., buttons).\nThumb Navigation Zones: Primary actions placed in the bottom third of the screen. Secondary actions higher up.\nContent Scaling: Content adapts to different screen sizes through flexible layouts and responsive text sizing.\n\n\n**Design System Flexibility:**\n(Guidance provided above in each functional area, emphasizing flexibility)\n\n\n\n**Success Validation**\n\n(Success criteria outlined in the original brief are addressed within this specification through the focus on flexible implementation and mobile-first design principles.)\n",
