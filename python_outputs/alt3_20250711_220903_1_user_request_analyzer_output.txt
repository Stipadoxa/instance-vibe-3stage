Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain focusing on product display and purchase initiation
User Type: Mobile shoppers browsing product listings
Platform Impact: Mobile users expect concise product information, large touch targets, and a simple purchase flow. Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient use of space and prioritization of key information.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase
Secondary Goals:  View product details on a separate page (tapping the card)
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during browsing

Ready for handoff if: All critical content (image, title, price, buy button) is clearly visible and appropriately sized for touch interaction; the visual hierarchy prioritizes the buy button; sufficient padding/spacing is present for comfortable touch targets.

Content Requirements
Critical: Product image, product title, product price, "Buy" button
Supporting:  Rating (stars),  short description (optional, depending on space)
Contextual:  Out-of-stock indicator (if applicable), sale badge (if applicable)

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single card layout, vertically stacked elements (image at the top, then title, price, button)
* Components: Image component (responsive), Text components (title, price), Button component ("Buy")
* Styling:  Use consistent styling for price (e.g., bold font), ensure sufficient contrast between text and background


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Initiate purchase ("Buy" button)
Secondary Actions: View detailed product page (tapping the card)
Screen States:  Default (product displayed),  loading (if applicable while fetching data), out-of-stock (if applicable)
Feedback Needs:  Visual feedback on button tap (e.g., slight color change).
