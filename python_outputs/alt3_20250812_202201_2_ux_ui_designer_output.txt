# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied
- **Typography Hierarchy**: The design leverages the provided typography system to establish clear visual hierarchy.  "Headline/Large" is used for the main product title, providing prominence and readability.  "Title/Medium" styles section headers (e.g., "Key Information," "Specifications"), while "Body/Large" is used for the main product description, and "Body/Medium" for supporting details within the specifications table. "Caption/Small" is used for the "Listed 3 days ago" timestamp.  This ensures that the importance of each text element is visually communicated effectively.

- **Spacing System**:  Consistent spacing is maintained using the design system's spacing tokens. `itemSpacing: 16` is used between major sections (e.g., product title and description, description and specifications). `itemSpacing: 8` is applied within the specifications table for tighter grouping of related data.  Padding values are also consistently applied to create visual breathing room and ensure a balanced layout. `paddingLeft/Right: 16` provides standard horizontal padding within content containers.

- **Component Behavior**:  The design utilizes the "product card" component as the primary building block to structure the product information. Fallback strategies were not necessary as this component satisfies the needs of the design.  The image carousel is implemented using the "IMAGES" component, which is well-suited for the requirement of showcasing multiple product images. For primary actions, the "Button" component with "Size: Large" and "Type: Filled" is used.  The "avatar / single" component is used to display the seller's profile picture, ensuring visual consistency.

- **Color Application**: The color palette is carefully selected to enhance readability and highlight important elements. The primary brand color ("Primary/primary50") is used sparingly for accents and CTAs ("Contact Seller" button).  "Neutral/neutral90" is used for primary text to maintain high contrast and readability against the white background ("White/white100").  "Neutral/neutral50" provides color for secondary text elements and labels.

- **Layout Strategy**: A vertical layout is employed, following the natural reading patterns.  The layout container uses `"layoutMode": "VERTICAL"` with `"itemSpacing: 16"`.  Individual sections may contain horizontal layouts for related content (e.g., specifications table).  This organization streamlines the user flow and improves visual clarity.

## Domain Context Integration
- **Industry Patterns**: The design aligns with typical e-commerce product page conventions. Key information (price, condition, seller details) is prominently displayed, followed by a detailed description and product specifications.  This ensures that the user experience is intuitive and consistent with established e-commerce patterns.

- **User Mental Models**: The structure of the page follows user expectations for a product detail page. Important information is presented upfront, with further details in subsequent sections.  This makes it easy for users to quickly scan the key features and then delve into more detailed information as needed.

- **Contextual Adaptations**: The design prioritizes mobile-first principles. To account for smaller screen real estate, the navigation structure for the mobile version would leverage the "Bottom navigation" component and potentially utilize expandable sections.  This provides ease of access to main functions, while reducing visual clutter.

## Design System Compliance
- **Component Verification**: All componentNodeIds were validated against the provided DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA.
- **Variant Completeness**: All necessary variants for selected components were carefully specified with valid values from the `variantDetails`.
- **Text Property Mapping**:  Exact `textLayers` names were utilized for all component text properties, ensuring seamless data integration with the design system.
- **Schema Adherence**: All component properties adhere strictly to the respective component definitions from the schema.
