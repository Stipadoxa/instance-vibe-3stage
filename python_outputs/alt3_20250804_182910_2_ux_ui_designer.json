The top section contains the user's profile picture (using an avatar component) and name, arranged horizontally. Below this, the email address is displayed followed by a horizontal divider (`10:8459`). The order history is presented as a list using the `10:10214` list item component. Each order in the list displays relevant details such as date, items, and total. Finally, an \"Edit Profile\" button (`10:3907`), styled as a primary button is placed at the bottom.  Consistent spacing of 16 pixels is used between sections. Full-width elements utilize `\"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"` where appropriate (not applicable for all components).\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward. Users see their profile information at a glance. The \"Edit Profile\" button leads to a separate screen to modify the details, enabling a clean and focused experience on this primary view.\n\n4. **Component Choices:**\n    * **Avatar:** I chose `10:7773` (avatar / big) over `10:7798` (avatar / single) and `24:10352` (avatar  / stack) because it allows for a larger profile picture, consistent with typical user profile pages. The `Photo` variant is set to \"Yes\".\n    * **List Item:** I chose `10:10214` (List item) for the order history because it provides a structured way to display multiple orders with headline (order summary) and supporting text (details) sections.  Variants used are tailored to present two lines of information (Condition: \"2-line\")\n    * **Button:** I chose `10:3907` (Button) for \"Edit Profile\" because it is a clear and universally understood call to action. The `Type` variant is set to \"Filled\" and the `Size` variant to \"Medium\", and `Color` to \"Green\"  for visual prominence.\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying user profile information holistically. Therefore, I combined existing components (`10:7773`, `10:10214`, `10:3907`, `native-text`) to achieve this functionality. This approach maintains a consistent visual style while effectively presenting the required information.  A dedicated Order History component would have been ideal, however, this current solution allows for expansion and better customization.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Visual hierarchy is established through size and placement. The name and avatar are prominent at the top.  The email address follows, then the order history is separated by a divider to enhance visual distinction. The \"Edit Profile\" button is placed at the bottom, and is colored green, improving it's visual prominence.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  Variant choices are detailed in section 4.  These selections ensure clarity, consistency and appropriate size for mobile and desktop layouts.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:**  `native-text` elements were utilized to display the user's name and email address. While a text component might seem appropriate, the direct use of `native-text` allows for precise control over text style to ensure it is visually distinct and prominent on the screen without needing to introduce additional components.\n\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"User Profile Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 16, \"paddingBottom\": 16, \"paddingLeft\": 16, \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\", \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"layoutContainer\": {\n          \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n          \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"component\",\n              \"id\": \"10:7773\",\n              \"variants\": {\n                \"Photo\": \"Yes\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"native-text\",\n              \"properties\": {\n                \"content\": \"Jane Doe\",\n                \"textStyle\": \"Headline/Medium\",\n                \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral90\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"native-text\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"content\": \"jane.doe@example.com\",\n          \"textStyle\": \"Body/Medium\",\n          \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral50\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:8459\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Position\": \"horizontal\",\n          \"Type\": \"full-width\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 8,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Condition\": \"2-line\",\n              \"Leading\": \"None\",\n              \"Trailing\": \"None\",\n              \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n              \"Show supporting text\": \"True\"\n            },\n            \"textLayers\": {\n              \"Headline\": \"Order #1234\",\n              \"Supporting text\": \"Date: 2023-10-26, Items: 2, Total: $50.00\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Condition\": \"2-line\",\n              \"Leading\": \"None\",\n              \"Trailing\": \"None\",\n              \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n              \"Show supporting text\": \"True\"\n            },\n            \"textLayers\": {\n              \"Headline\": \"Order #5678\",\n              \"Supporting text\": \"Date: 2023-11-15, Items: 1, Total: $25.00\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n          \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"Default\",\n          \"Color\": \"Green\"\n        },\n        \"textLayers\": {\n          \"Action\": \"Edit Profile\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
