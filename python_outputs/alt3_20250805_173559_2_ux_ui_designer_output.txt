I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout (`layoutMode: "VERTICAL"`) to present the form fields sequentially.  Each input field and the button are full-width (`horizontalSizing: "FILL"`) to optimize screen real estate on various screen sizes.  The "Forgot password?" link is placed below the button for clarity and accessibility.  Consistent spacing of 16 pixels is used between elements for visual breathing room.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward:  The user enters their email, then their password, and finally taps the "Login" button.  The "Forgot password?" link provides an alternative path for users who have forgotten their credentials.

4. **Component Choices:**
    * **Email Input Field:** I chose the `10:8492` ("text input") component for both email and password fields due to its standard form element functionality and built-in placeholder text. I considered using `10:8619` ("text area"), but it's not suitable for single-line input and would occupy excessive vertical space.  No other input components were found that supported secure password input.
    * **Password Input Field:**  The design system lacks a secure input component, so this is addressed using `native-text` with a visual indicator (see below).  `10:8492` ("text input") is used for the visual layout.
    * **Login Button:** I used the `10:3907` ("Button") component for the login action. The `Size` variant is set to "Medium," and the `Color` variant to "Green" for a clear call to action.  I considered `Type: "Outlined"` but `Type: "Filled"` provides more visual prominence.
    * **Forgot Password Link:**  A `native-text` element is used for the "Forgot password?" link due to the lack of a dedicated link component in the system.  The text style is set to be a less prominent version of the body text style (`S:963691efd88605f3543e1770d2ee930d56487d4a`) to indicate a secondary action, a common UI pattern.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks components for secure password input and a dedicated link component.  Secure input is simulated with a `native-text` element and an eye icon to toggle password visibility, while the "Forgot password?" text is styled as a `native-text` element with appropriate link styling.  This ensures functionality while adhering to the core principles of using native elements only to solve specific functional gaps.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established through the use of text sizes and styles. The input field labels use `S:84b5650ed8afb653e011f47f7abbb037675b87cf` ("Label/Large") text style for better visibility, while the "Forgot password?" link uses a smaller, less prominent text style (`S:bd915a8e249e62bcbd25e1452467f0d46e3e59fc`) from the Body Styles. The login button has a larger size variant and uses the primary color to make it the most prominent element.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** The `10:3907` ("Button") component uses the "Medium" size variant for optimal usability on different screen sizes.  I chose `Color: "Green"` to be consistent with the design system's call-to-action style and provide a clear visual cue for the primary action.  The "Filled" type was chosen over "Outlined" as it is more prominent and commonly used for primary actions.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  Native elements `native-text` are used for the password field to ensure visual feedback when the password is hidden (visually represented with an eye icon toggle).  This functionality is not available in existing components.   A `native-text` component is also used for the "Forgot Password?" link, styled appropriately as a clickable element, as there's no dedicated link component in the provided system.
