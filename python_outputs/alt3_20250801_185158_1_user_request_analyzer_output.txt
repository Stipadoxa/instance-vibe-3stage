    "reasoning": "While a product detail page is crucial for e-commerce conversions, it shouldn't overwhelm the user.  An 'enhanced' treatment uses design system components as a base, but allows for visual enhancements like high-quality photography, subtle animations, and a more sophisticated layout to guide users toward contacting the seller without disrupting the core functionality.  The prominence of the 'Contact Seller' button directly impacts conversion rates, justifying a slightly more expressive approach within the bounds of the system."
