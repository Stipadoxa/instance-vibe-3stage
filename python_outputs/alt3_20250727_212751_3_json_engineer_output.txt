The provided UX UI Designer output uses generic placeholder text like "Notification Title," "Notification Description," etc.  This violates the "ZERO TOLERANCE" rule against generic templates.  Data extraction cannot proceed until a valid input with real content is provided.  The current input is unusable for JSON generation due to the high risk of template-based output.  The process must be restarted with an input containing actual content instead of generic placeholders.
