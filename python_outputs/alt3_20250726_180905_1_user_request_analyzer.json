  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain with a focus on user notifications.\nUser Type: Mobile users who need to access and manage their notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily scannable list, prioritizing important information due to screen size limitations.  Touch interaction and potential interruptions need to be considered.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals: Potentially mark notifications as read, access the context of each notification by tapping on it.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile, users may only glance at the list briefly, touch-based interaction.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp. Top bar with user info and bottom navigation are present and functional. All UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar.\nSupporting:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., badge or visual cue).\nContextual:  Potentially a \"Mark as Read\" option (per notification or bulk).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list of 5 notification items.  Top bar for user information. Bottom navigation bar.\n* Components: Notification Item (repeating component): User Avatar (circular image), Title (text, bold), Description (text), Timestamp (text, smaller font). Top Bar: User Avatar, User Name. Bottom Navigation:  (Number of tabs not specified, further information required).\n* Styling:  (Specific styling details are not provided, further information is needed).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification).\nSecondary Actions:  Mark as read (if implemented).\nScreen States: Default (showing 5 notifications), potentially empty state (no notifications).  Loading state (if fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of unread notifications.  Feedback on successful \"Mark as Read\" action (if implemented).\n",
