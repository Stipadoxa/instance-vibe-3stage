  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Unspecified domain; modification request on an existing mobile application.  The original design intent is unknown beyond the presence of a JSON object `{\"test\": true}` which suggests a very basic application or a test environment.\nUser Type: Mobile users interacting with a simple application.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users require a simple, intuitive interface with clear touch targets and minimal steps.  Screen real estate is limited.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Interact with the application's core functionality (currently unknown but implied by the original `{\"test\": true}` JSON). Add a button to the existing interface.\nSecondary Goals: The addition of the button should maintain ease of use and not disrupt the existing functionality.  The purpose of the button itself is undefined.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on a mobile device;  the button must integrate seamlessly without disrupting the existing, currently unknown, layout.\nReady for handoff if: The new button is visually distinct, has appropriate touch target size, and does not overlap or obscure existing elements.  Functionality of the button is defined and implemented.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  The existing JSON data `{\"test\": true}` (or its visual representation) must be retained.  A new button element must be added.\nSupporting:  Any supporting content depends entirely on the intended functionality of the new button.\nContextual:  None specified, depends on button functionality.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: The existing layout (currently unknown) must be preserved. The button's placement within the layout needs to be specified.\n* Components: Add a new button component.  Specifications regarding the button's appearance (text, icon, style) are needed.\n* Styling:  Button styling (color, shape, size, etc.) needs to be defined to maintain consistency with the existing (unknown) design.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Interact with existing functionality (undefined) and the new button.\nSecondary Actions:  None specified beyond those already present.\nScreen States:  Additional states might be needed depending on the button's functionality (e.g., loading state, success state, error state).\nFeedback Needs: Visual feedback for button presses (e.g., change in color or appearance) is necessary.\n\n\n",
