  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display of information, prioritization of essential content due to limited screen real estate, and consideration for touch interactions.  Notifications should be easily scannable and actionable.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Quickly assess the importance of each notification, potentially take action based on notification content (though specific actions aren't detailed in the request).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen size on mobile, touch-based interaction, potential for distractions while viewing notifications.\nReady for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction and easily legible.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar.\nSupporting:  None specified in the request.\nContextual:  Potentially a counter indicating unread notifications (though not explicitly mentioned).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components:  Top bar (containing user info), Notification Item (repeating component with user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation (5 tabs).\n* Styling:  No specific styling requirements are mentioned in the request.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (implied, not explicitly stated).\nSecondary Actions:  None explicitly specified in the request (potential actions would depend on the notification type).\nScreen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications).  Potentially additional states for loading, no notifications, or error conditions (though not detailed in the request).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications (implied).\n",
