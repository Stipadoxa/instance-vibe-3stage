Domain & Context
Domain:  Generic application domain with an existing UI element ("test").  The context suggests a simple UI with a boolean value.
User Type: Mobile users interacting with a simple application.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform constraints necessitate concise UI, large touch targets, and consideration for interruptions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals:  Interact with the application and utilize a newly added functionality (the button).
Secondary Goals: Maintain the existing functionality represented by the `{"test": true}` JSON.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if: The button is clearly visible, appropriately sized for touch interaction, and its functionality is defined and integrated without disrupting the existing "test" functionality.

Content Requirements
Critical: The existing JSON data (`{"test": true}`) must be retained.  A new button element must be added.
Supporting:  Clear visual indication of the button's purpose.
Contextual:  The button's behavior might change based on the state of `{"test": true}` (although this is not specified).

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  The existing layout needs to accommodate a new button element without significant restructuring.  The placement of the button should be determined based on usability best practices for mobile.
* Components:  A new button component needs to be added.  Specific styling (size, color, label) needs to be determined.
* Styling: The button styling should align with existing mobile UI guidelines to maintain consistency.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Interact with the new button.
Secondary Actions:  Interact with any existing functionality implied by `{"test": true}` (this needs clarification).
Screen States: At least two states â€“ one before the button interaction and one after.
Feedback Needs: Visual feedback (e.g., state change) after the button is pressed.  Error handling if applicable.
