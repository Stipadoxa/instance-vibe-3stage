  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage and view their notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily scannable notification list due to limited screen real estate.  Touch interaction is primary, and interruptions are likely.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read, potentially interact directly with notifications (e.g., respond to a message).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All five notification items are clearly displayed, user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are visible for each, top bar and bottom navigation are present and functional, and the list is easily scrollable.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notification items. User information in the top bar. Navigation options in the bottom navigation.\nSupporting:  Notification read/unread status indicator.\nContextual:  Loading indicator if notifications are still being fetched.  \"No notifications\" message if the list is empty.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list of notifications, top bar for user info, bottom navigation bar.\n* Components: Top Bar (User avatar, User Name), Notification Item (User Avatar, Title, Description, Timestamp), Bottom Navigation (at least 2-5 tabs).\n* Styling:  To be determined by the UX designer, in keeping with the overall app design.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification item).\nSecondary Actions:  Mark notifications as read (potentially with a swipe gesture), access the screen linked to by each notification.\nScreen States: Default state (showing 5 notification items), loading state, empty state (\"No notifications\").\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of read/unread status, smooth scrolling, loading indicator feedback.\n",
