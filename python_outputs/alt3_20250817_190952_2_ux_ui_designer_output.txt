# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied

- **Typography Hierarchy**: The design leverages the provided headline and body text styles to establish a clear visual hierarchy.  "Headline/Large" is used for the main product title, "Headline/Medium" for key information sections (like Specifications), and "Body/Large" for the product description.  "Title/Medium" is used for subheadings within sections. This ensures readability and emphasizes important information.

- **Spacing System**: `itemSpacing` tokens (8, 16, 24) are used consistently to create visual breathing room between sections and elements.  Padding is applied within containers (`paddingTop`, `paddingBottom`, `paddingLeft`, `paddingRight`) to create a comfortable reading experience, aligning with the design system's recommended values.

- **Component Behavior**: The design utilizes the `appbar` component for top navigation, integrating back and share icons.  The `Bottom navigation` component is used for bottom navigation.  Where suitable components were not available in the DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA, native elements were used to create a cohesive design. For example, a `layoutContainer` with `native-text` and `native-rectangle` elements was used for the product specifications section.

- **Color Application**: The color system is meticulously followed using exact color names from the DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA. Primary colors (`Primary/primary50`) are used for CTAs (Contact Seller), secondary colors for less prominent actions (Add to Watchlist), and neutral colors (`Neutral/neutral90`) for text and dividers.  This ensures brand consistency and clarity.

- **Layout Strategy**:  The design strictly adheres to the three-container mobile app architecture pattern to achieve a consistent layout across all screens.  This guarantees edge-to-edge screen usage and a clear separation of navigation and content areas.  Vertical (`layoutMode: "VERTICAL"`) and horizontal (`layoutMode: "HORIZONTAL"`) containers are used strategically to manage the layout of elements.


## Domain Context Integration

- **Industry Patterns**: The design incorporates common e-commerce patterns, such as product image carousels, prominent pricing, detailed specifications, seller profiles (with rating and image), product descriptions, and clear call-to-action buttons.  This is expected and familiar to e-commerce users, creating a consistent shopping experience.

- **User Mental Models**: The layout and information architecture are designed to align with users' expectations.  Key information (price, condition, seller profile) is presented prominently, allowing users to quickly evaluate the listing.  Specifications are grouped logically in a structured format.  This respects the user's time and decision-making process.

- **Contextual Adaptations**:  Since a seller's rating might not always be available, the design accounts for the absence of seller ratings by displaying "Seller has no ratings yet".  Similarly, a placeholder image is used for the image carousel if no images are uploaded. This ensures a robust and seamless user experience in all situations.


## Design System Compliance

- **Component Verification**: All componentNodeIds used in the design specification are verified against the provided DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA.
- **Variant Completeness**: All variants for the utilized components are specified with valid values from the DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA.
- **Text Property Mapping**: The design accurately maps user content to the corresponding textLayers names specified in the component schemas.
- **Schema Adherence**: All properties in the JSON specification precisely adhere to the definitions outlined in the component schemas from DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA.

# DESIGN SPECIFICATION

The JSON above provides a complete specification for the mobile product details screen.  It leverages components from the design system where possible and falls back to native elements when necessary.  The three-container architecture is strictly adhered to, ensuring a robust and consistent mobile experience.  The design is optimized for mobile-first principles, user readability and interaction, and design system compliance. The "Product Details" title is concise and suitable for the app bar.  The complete product title is displayed as the first element in the content area, using the appropriate headline style.  Colors are referenced using their exact names and all components are fully specified.  The design incorporates a fallback mechanism for missing images and ratings. The structure is clean, easy to understand, and directly implementable by the engineering team.
