Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in.
Platform Impact: Mobile users require a concise, touch-friendly interface, with a focus on efficient authentication and minimal input.  Limited screen real-estate necessitates prioritization of key information.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login for faster access, recover forgotten password.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All required fields are present, input fields are appropriately sized for touch interaction, error handling is implemented, and the visual hierarchy prioritizes the primary login button.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), password recovery link.
Contextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, etc.), success message upon successful login, "Remember me" checkbox (optional),  Terms & Conditions acceptance footnote.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout for fields and buttons, optimizing for vertical space.  Social media buttons positioned below the primary login button.
* Components:  Input fields for username/email and password, primary button labeled "Log In," social media login buttons (use platform-standard icons), password recovery link styled as a subtle secondary link. Footnote text below all elements.
* Styling:  Adhere to the visual style of the provided reference image,  using a clean and uncluttered design.  Main button should visually stand out from the rest of the elements.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions:  Social media login.
Screen States: Default state, loading state (during authentication), error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirect to app).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation of input fields, clear error messages with suggestions for correction, visual indication of loading.
