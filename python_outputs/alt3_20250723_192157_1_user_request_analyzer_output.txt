Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.
User Type: Mobile application users attempting to log in.
Platform Impact: Mobile users require a streamlined, touch-friendly interface, with clear visual hierarchy and minimal input fields due to limited screen real estate.  They may be in distracting environments and have varying network conditions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize convenient social media login options, recover forgotten credentials.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions, limited attention span.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements have sufficient tap targets for mobile use,  error handling is implemented for invalid credentials, password recovery flow is clearly accessible, and a clear visual indication confirms successful login.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, password recovery link, terms & conditions acceptance indication.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google).
Contextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout to optimize vertical space on mobile screen.  Fields stacked vertically.  Social login buttons below primary login button.
* Components: Username/Email field (text input), Password field (secure text input), Primary login button (prominent styling), Secondary buttons for social media login (styled consistently, likely smaller than the primary button),  Hyperlink for password recovery (styled consistently),  Checkbox or similar for Terms & Conditions acceptance (small discreet),  Footer with copyright/version information.
* Styling:  Referencing the provided visual example, use a clean and minimalist design.  Consistent use of spacing and padding between elements.  Primary button should stand out while maintaining a unified design language with the reference image.  Color palette should be clean and intuitive.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Login via social media accounts.
Screen States: Default (login form displayed), Loading (progress indicator visible), Error (displaying appropriate error messages), Success (redirecting to the app's main screen).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation of email format, clear error messages for incorrect credentials or other issues, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., transition to the next screen), loading indicator for authentication process.
