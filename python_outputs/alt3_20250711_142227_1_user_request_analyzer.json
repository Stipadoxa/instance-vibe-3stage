  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise form design.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable)\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is visible (or clear path to recovery), form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and all fields are accessible via keyboard navigation for assistive technologies.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button\nSupporting: Password recovery link, \"Remember me\" checkbox (optional),  \"Forgot Password?\" link\nContextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n\n* Layout: Single-column layout to maximize vertical space utilization.\n* Components:  Clearly labeled text input fields for username/email and password.  A visually distinct button for login.  A link for password recovery.\n* Styling:  Consistent with overall mobile app styling guidelines.  Use of sufficient padding and spacing to accommodate touch interaction.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials\nSecondary Actions: Initiate password recovery\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirection to account)\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format (if applicable), clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n",
