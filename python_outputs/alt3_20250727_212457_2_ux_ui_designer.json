This approach prioritizes a clear and concise presentation of information within the limited screen real estate of a mobile application.\",\n    \"userFlowReasoning\": \"The primary user flow is viewing a list of notifications.  Tapping a notification item will (in a future iteration) lead to a detailed view of that specific notification. Bottom navigation provides access to other application sections.\",\n    \"componentChoices\": \"I chose the \\\"appbar\\\" (id: 10:5620) component for the top bar, the \\\"list-item\\\" (id: 10:10214) component for each notification item, and the \\\"Bottom navigation\\\" (id: 10:4724) component for the bottom navigation.  I selected these components over alternatives like \\\"snackbar\\\" (id: 10:3856) for the top bar (because snackbars are for transient messages, not persistent UI elements like a header) and  \\\"card\\\" (id: 147:3743) for the notification items (cards are generally used for more self-contained units of content), and \\\"tabs\\\" (id: 10:7852) for bottom navigation (because tabs imply switching between distinct views within the same domain and bottom nav is for top-level navigation). The selected components are suitable for their respective content and interaction patterns.\",\n    \"visualHierarchy\": \"Visual hierarchy is established through the use of clear visual distinctions between the UI elements.  The app bar is positioned at the top with larger text sizes and a consistent background color, immediately conveying its importance. Notification items follow, with consistent styling and ample spacing, and bottom navigation is placed at the very bottom.\",\n    \"variantSelectionRationale\": \"For the appbar, I chose \\\"Mode\\\": \\\"Light\\\" because it provides better contrast and visibility. For the list-item, I selected \\\"Condition\\\": \\\"2-line\\\", \\\"Leading\\\": \\\"Image\\\", \\\"Trailing\\\": \\\"None\\\", \\\"Show overline\\\": \\\"False\\\", and \\\"Show supporting text\\\": \\\"True\\\".  These variants allow for display of the user avatar and notification description in multiple lines as needed. The absence of \\\"Trailing\\\" elements and \\\"Overline\\\" maintain a streamlined design.  I rejected using \\\"Leading\\\": \\\"Icon\\\"  because the user avatar serves a similar visual purpose.  The supporting text displays the notification timestamp.\"\n  }\n}\n---RATIONALE-SEPARATOR---\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Communication Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 8,\n    \"paddingTop\": 0,\n    \"paddingBottom\": 0,\n    \"paddingLeft\": 0,\n    \"paddingRight\": 0,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"10:5620\",\n        \"type\": \"appbar\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Mode\": \"Light\",\n          \"Type\": \"Default\",\n          \"Elevation\": \"flat\"\n        },\n        \"props\": {\n          \"headline\": \"Notifications\",\n          \"subheadline\": \"Recent activity\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"type\": \"list-item\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"2-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"Image\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"None\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"True\"\n        },\n        \"props\": {\n          \"Headline\": \"User 1\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"New message received at 10:00 AM\",\n          \"Trailing supporting text\": \"10:00 AM\"\n        },\n        \"repeats\": 5\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"10:4724\",\n        \"type\": \"navigation\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Device\": \"Mobile\"\n        },\n        \"props\": {\n          \"✏️ Label\": [\n            \"Home\",\n            \"Saved\",\n            \"Sell\",\n            \"Chat\",\n            \"Profile\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
