Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile users require concise information presentation due to screen size limitations; touch interaction is primary; interruptions are common; location awareness is not directly relevant to this screen.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View recent notifications, understand notification content (title, description), and potentially take action based on the notification.
Secondary Goals: Quickly assess notification importance based on visual cues (avatar, timestamp), navigate to related content from within the notification.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch interaction, potential interruptions during notification review.
Ready for handoff if:  Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.


Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar, bottom navigation elements.
Supporting:  Number of unread notifications (badge or counter).
Contextual:  Indicator of notification action status (e.g., read/unread status).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.
* Components: Top bar (containing user info, potentially a "settings" icon), Notification Item Component (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation (with appropriate icons and labels).
* Styling:  Appropriate styling for avatars, text sizes, and spacing to ensure readability and visual hierarchy within the constraints of a mobile screen.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification item).
Secondary Actions:  Navigate to other sections of the app via bottom navigation.
Screen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of read/unread status for notifications.
