Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.
Secondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable).
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and all fields are accessible via keyboard.


Content Requirements
Critical: Email field, password field, login button, error message area.
Supporting: Password recovery link,  "Remember me" checkbox (optional).
Contextual: Loading indicator during authentication,  specific error messages for invalid credentials (e.g., "Incorrect email or password").


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions:  Access account creation (link to registration page), access help/support (link or icon).
Screen States: Default state, loading state, error state (incorrect credentials), success state (redirect to account dashboard).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual feedback upon successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).

**Structural & Component Directives**
*Layout: Single column layout to maximize vertical space.*
*Components:  Email input field (with email validation), password input field (with password visibility toggle), login button (prominent), password recovery link (subtle but clear), potentially a "Remember me" checkbox.*
*Styling:  Use clear and consistent visual hierarchy.  Button should have sufficient tap target size for mobile usability.*
