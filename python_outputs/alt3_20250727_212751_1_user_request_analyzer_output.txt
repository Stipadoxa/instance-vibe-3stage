Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users who need to manage and view notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display, prioritization of critical information, and touch-based interaction.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient use of space.


User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read, access the source of the notification (if applicable).
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-based interaction, potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info and bottom navigation are present and functional; all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction and easily visible.


Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications; user information in the top bar.
Supporting:  Notification read/unread status indicator (visual cue).
Contextual:  Error messages (e.g., "No notifications"), loading indicator (if fetching notifications).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.
* Components: Top bar (user info), list of notification items (each with avatar, title, description, timestamp), bottom navigation.
* Styling:  (Not specified, requires further design decisions)


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (potentially by tapping on an item).
Secondary Actions: Mark notifications as read (potentially implied via interaction).
Screen States:  Default state (showing notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of read/unread notifications.
