Okay, I'm ready to act as an expert JSON Engineer, translating UI Designer specifications into production-ready Figma plugin JSON. I will strictly adhere to all the provided CRITICAL rules and best practices regarding Auto-Layout creation, `layoutAlign`, padding, icon/text properties, preventing 1px width elements, and consistent sizing.

**Please provide me with the UI Designer specifications you want me to translate.  The more detail you provide, the more accurate and efficient the JSON output will be.  This includes:**

* **A description of the UI:**  What is the overall layout?  (e.g., a login screen, a settings page, a product detail view).
* **Component details:** What Figma components are used (e.g., `appbar`, `list-item`, `button`, `native-text`, `input`) and their properties (text content, icons, etc.).  Provide specific `componentNodeId`s if possible.
* **Layout details:** How are the components arranged?  Is it a vertical or horizontal layout?  Are there nested containers?  What are the desired widths and heights of containers and elements?
* **Spacing and padding requirements:**  Specify the desired spacing between components, padding around containers, etc.
* **Any specific styling requirements:** Font sizes, colors, etc. (While not directly part of the JSON structure for component instantiation, this information can help me make better decisions about padding and layout).


Once I have this information, I will generate the corresponding Figma plugin JSON, ensuring it complies with all the specified rules and best practices.  I will also provide clear comments to explain the structure and choices made.
