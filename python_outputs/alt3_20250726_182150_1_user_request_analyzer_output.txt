Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display, touch interaction, and consideration for screen real estate limitations.  The design must account for interruptions and potential background processes.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals: Quickly assess the importance of each notification, potentially interact with each notification (e.g., mark as read, take action based on notification).
User Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch interactions, potential for interruptions while viewing notifications.
Ready for handoff if:  Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications; User information in top bar.
Supporting:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., badge count).
Contextual:  Potentially a "mark as read" option for each notification, actions related to the notification content (e.g., a link to a specific page).

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list of notifications, each notification in a separate row. Top bar at the top of the screen; bottom navigation at the bottom of the screen.
* Components: Top bar (containing user info), Notification Item (containing user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation (containing navigation elements).
* Styling:  Appropriate styling for all UI elements to align with the overall application design.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details.
Secondary Actions: Mark as read (potential), take action based on notification (potential).
Screen States: Default state (showing five notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (if loading notifications).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual indicators of unread notifications, smooth scrolling of the notification list.
