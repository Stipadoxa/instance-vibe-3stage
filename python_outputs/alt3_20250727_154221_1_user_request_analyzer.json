  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile application users needing to access their accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick and secure access with a touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, gain access to the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media login options, recover forgotten credentials.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Primary action (login button) is clearly prominent, all fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction, error messages are clearly displayed, and sufficient spacing is provided for readability.  Password recovery and T&C links are easily accessible and visually distinct.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (specify platforms), password recovery link.\nContextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials), loading indicator during authentication.  Footnote indicating acceptance of T&C upon login.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single column layout optimized for mobile vertical scrolling.\n* Components:  Text input fields (username/email, password),  primary button (\"Log In\"), secondary buttons (Social Media Logins - specify platforms),  hyperlink for password recovery,  footnote regarding T&C acceptance.\n* Styling:  Consistent with overall app branding. Buttons should have clear visual hierarchy, with the primary login button being most prominent.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Social media login.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirect to app content).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (if applicable), clear and concise error messages, loading indicator during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., transition to the next screen).\n",
