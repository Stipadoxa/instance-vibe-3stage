### Enhanced Output Structure

**SECTION 1: DESIGN RATIONALE**

# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied

**Typography Hierarchy:** The design leverages the provided typography system to establish a clear visual hierarchy.  "Headline/Large" is used for the main product title ("2020 Dell XPS 13 - Used") to give it prominence. "Title/Medium" styles section headers (e.g., "Key Information," "Seller Information"). "Body/Large" is used for the main product description, ensuring readability.  "Body/Medium" styles secondary information like specifications and "Caption/Small" is used for metadata such as "Posted: 3 days ago." This ensures a consistent and easily scannable experience.

**Spacing System:** The design utilizes the provided spacing tokens to create visual harmony and separation between content blocks.  `itemSpacing: 16` is used between major sections like the product images and the description. `itemSpacing: 8` is used for more closely related content within a section.  Padding is applied to containers to create breathing room and ensure elements are not cramped. The `Standard Content Container Pattern` is used for most sections to maintain consistency.

**Component Behavior:** The design understands and utilizes the behavior of available components.  For example, the "Button" component (componentNodeId: "10:3907") is used for primary actions ("Contact Seller," "Add to Cart") with the `Size: "Large"` and `Type: "Filled"` variants to maximize visual impact and tappability.  The lack of a suitable image gallery component necessitates using native image components to display multiple product images.

**Color Application:** The color palette is carefully selected to align with the design system.  The "Primary/primary50" (#00b53f) color is used sparingly for key actions (buttons) to highlight them against the predominantly neutral background. "Neutral/neutral90" (#304049) and "Neutral/neutral50" (#6c8ea0) are used for primary and secondary text respectively, ensuring good contrast and readability. Backgrounds consistently utilize "White/white100" (#ffffff).


**Layout Strategy:** The layout employs a vertical layout, following a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal usability on smaller screens.  The visual hierarchy and spacing create a natural top-to-bottom reading flow.  The `Standard Content Container Pattern` is frequently used for consistency.  Images are placed prominently at the top, followed by key information, then the detailed description.



## Domain Context Integration

**Industry Patterns:** The design incorporates common e-commerce patterns, such as prominent product images, clear pricing, concise product information, and prominent call-to-action buttons.  Seller information and ratings help to build trust and credibility.

**User Mental Models:** The layout prioritizes information based on user expectations in an e-commerce context: images first, then key details (price, condition), followed by more detailed specifications and seller information. The placement of primary actions ("Contact Seller", "Add to Cart") reinforces a clear path to purchase or interaction.

**Contextual Adaptations:** The design system lacks a dedicated "Product Card" component; therefore, fallback strategy is used to leverage other elements and build out the visual structure.  The lack of a dedicated image gallery component means using native image elements is necessary.

## Design System Compliance

**Component Verification:** All componentNodeIds are verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

**Variant Completeness:** All necessary variants are specified for chosen components where applicable and values are valid.

**Text Property Mapping:**  Text content is mapped precisely to the appropriate textLayers within chosen components, leveraging textHierarchy.

**Schema Adherence:** Component properties precisely adhere to their respective definitions in the schema and fallback mechanisms are used where necessary.
