**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical list (`layoutMode: "VERTICAL"`) to present each notification type clearly.  Each list item (`10:10214`) contains a toggle switch (`10:9912`), descriptive text, and leading space for visual separation. `itemSpacing` is set to 16 for comfortable visual breathing room between items.  Padding is used to create a margin around the content. No full-width elements are needed.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user can easily scan the list of notification types and toggle each one on or off with a simple tap.  The clear labeling and descriptive text ensures understanding. The persistent nature of the toggle switch ensures that the user's preference remains until changed.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `list-item` component (`10:10214`) with a `switch` component (`10:9912`) inside to create the notification settings layout. This component combination is chosen over using only native elements because the pre-built `list-item` component handles the visual styling and layout of the list.  Alternatives considered but rejected included the `card` component (`147:3743`), as it adds unnecessary visual complexity for a simple settings screen and the `filter-chip` component (`10:8132`), which would not be well suited to a toggle.

5. **Component Gaps:** No significant component gaps were encountered. The design system provides components fully sufficient to build this screen.


6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Visual hierarchy is established through the vertical list, clear labels using the `Body/Medium` (`S:bd915a8e249e62bcbd25e1452467f0d46e3e59fc`) text style, and consistent spacing.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `switch` component (`10:9912`), the `State: "enabled"` variant is used to ensure interactive toggles.  `Selected: "false"` is the default state for all switches.  No `Icon` variant is necessary for this screen. For the `list-item` component (`10:10214`), the `Condition: "1-line"`, `Leading: "Switch"`, and `Trailing: "None"` variants were selected to ensure that each item has only a switch at the beginning. The other options for condition and trailing were not relevant in the required layout.


8. **Native Element Justification:**  No native elements are required.  All functionality can be achieved using existing components from the Design System.
