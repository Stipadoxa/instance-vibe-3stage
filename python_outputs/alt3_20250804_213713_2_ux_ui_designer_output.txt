**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The dashboard homepage uses a vertical layout.  The top section contains three `stat-cards` (total listings, views this week, messages) arranged horizontally with equal spacing for visual balance. Below this, a `recent-activity-feed` is displayed, followed by a horizontal layout containing "Create New Listing" and "View All Messages" buttons.  The bottom navigation bar is placed at the very bottom of the screen.  Consistent 16px padding is used around content sections for readability and visual breathing room.  All horizontalSizing properties are set to "FILL" for images and native text elements where full width is required.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is designed to provide immediate access to key metrics and actions.  Top-level statistics offer a quick overview, followed by a chronologically ordered feed of recent events. Action buttons offer direct pathways to key tasks. Bottom navigation provides a consistent way to move between major sections of the application.

4. **Component Choices:**  
    * **Stat Cards:** No direct "stat-card" component was found.  To achieve the required functionality, I used a combination of `native-rectangle` with rounded corners, `native-text` components for the numeric value and label, and `icon` components (e.g., `635:4317` for home) from the system for visual clarity. This approach prioritizes customizability and a clean visual representation of the data.  Alternatives considered were none due to the absence of a similar component.
    * **Recent Activity Feed:** The absence of a feed component led to employing `native-list-item` to display entries in a vertical scrollable list. The ideal component would have built-in data integration and better handling of large datasets.
    * **Buttons:** The `10:3907` "Button" component was used for "Create New Listing" and "View All Messages" buttons.  I chose this over potentially using only native elements because it ensures consistent styling across the application and provides built-in state management (hover, pressed).
    * **Bottom Navigation:** The `10:4724` "Bottom navigation" component was utilized, providing a consistent user experience and efficient navigation to other app sections.  Alternatives were not considered given the functional suitability of this component.


5. **Component Gaps:**  The design system lacks dedicated components for "stat cards" and a "recent activity feed". The workaround for stat cards was a combination of native shapes, texts, and existing icon components. I used native-list-item for the activity feed, providing essential functionality but requiring more development effort than an ideal component would. This strategy ensures functional UI within design system constraints.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established using size, placement, and color. The stat cards are the most prominent, followed by the activity feed, and lastly the action buttons and bottom navigation.  Clear visual separation and padding improve the overall structure.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  I selected "Medium" Size for the Button component  because it provides an appropriate balance between screen real estate and tappability.  Other size variants were considered, but a medium-sized button best fit the context of the dashboard.

8. **Native Element Justification:** Native elements (`native-rectangle`, `native-text`, `native-list-item`) were used to create the stat cards and activity feed because no appropriate pre-built components existed.  This native implementation allows flexibility in styling and adapting to the specific data requirements and layout of the stat cards and feed.  For instance, the use of `native-text` allowed for optimal typography sizes and weight choices.
