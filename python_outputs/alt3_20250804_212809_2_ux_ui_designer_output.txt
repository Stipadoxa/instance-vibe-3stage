I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been manually verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout utilizes a vertical structure. The top section features a full-width image gallery using `native-rectangle` components for image placeholders due to the absence of a dedicated image gallery component in the design system.  This ensures images are prominent and engaging. Below, sections for title, price, condition, seller profile, and description follow, each with appropriate spacing (16px) for readability. The "Contact Seller" button is placed at the bottom for clear call to action.  Full-width elements (like titles and description) use `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` in their respective containers.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is designed to be linear and intuitive. Users first see the product images, then key information (title, price, condition), followed by seller details to build trust, and finally, a clear call to action to contact the seller.  This prioritizes quick comprehension and engagement.

4. **Component Choices:** There is no ideal component in the design system to manage an image gallery.  `native-rectangle` with `IMAGE` fills is used for each image, allowing for a flexible and responsive image display compared to potential alternatives that would require more workarounds. A standard `button` component is used for "Contact Seller" instead of a more complex button style because this is the most appropriate for this context.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying a product image gallery.  Strategy C (Native Elements) was used to create full-width image placeholders using multiple `native-rectangle` components with image fills. This allows for a flexible and responsive layout. Additionally, a rating system was required, however only individual stars and not a rating component was available.  Therefore, a native structure is used to construct it.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through: (a) Large, full-width hero image gallery at the top; (b) Title and price in prominent `Headline/Medium` text style; (c) clear section dividers; and (d) consistent spacing and typography.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  N/A. Variants are only used for components, and in this case native elements are used due to design system limitations.

8. **Native Element Justification:** The requirement to display multiple product images in a full-width, scrollable gallery necessitated the use of multiple `native-rectangle` components to act as image placeholders. This approach provides the necessary functionality that is not available in the provided design system. A rating component is also absent, so a `native-rectangle`-based structure has been created to represent this.
