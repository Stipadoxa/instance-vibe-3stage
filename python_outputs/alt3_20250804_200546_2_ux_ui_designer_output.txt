I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to present information in a clear, sequential manner.  The `itemSpacing` is set to 16 for comfortable visual breathing room between elements.  Padding is applied to the content section for visual balance and to prevent content from feeling cramped against the edges.  All input fields and the button utilize `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to ensure they span the full width of the screen for a modern and consistent look.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward.  The user is presented with email and password fields, then prompted to submit their credentials.  A "Forgot Password" link provides a clear path for password recovery if needed.  The visual hierarchy guides the user's attention to the input fields and then the login button, reinforcing the primary action.

4. **Component Choices:**
    * **Input Fields:** I chose the `"10:8492"` (text input) component over no alternatives because it's the only input field component available in the design system that directly fulfills the requirement.  The component's built-in placeholder and error handling capabilities enhance usability.
    * **Login Button:** I selected the `"10:3907"` (Button) component with variants  `{"Platform": "Android+Web", "Size": "Medium", "Type": "Filled", "State": "Default", "Color": "Green"}` over alternatives such as the "Outlined" or "Text" button types because a filled button visually emphasizes the primary action of logging in. The Medium size is appropriate for the screen context and maintains consistency.
    * **Forgot Password Link:** No suitable component was found for the Forgot Password functionality, thus a native-text element was used as a workaround strategy.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for a "Forgot Password" link styled consistently with the rest of the design.  I used a `native-text` element styled with the `"Label/Medium"` text style from the design system to create a visually integrated link. This provides a consistent look and feel while addressing the functional need for a password reset option.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established through the following:  Larger text sizes are used for labels; standard spacing helps with visual grouping and distinction; the login button's color and position highlight the primary call to action.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** The selection of variants for the button was detailed above in Component Choices.  For the Input fields, I selected `{"Type": "Filled", "State": "enabled"}` as the default states are appropriate for the user experience.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  As mentioned above, a `native-text` element was used to implement the "Forgot Password" link because no suitable component existed in the design system to create this styled link effectively.  This provides a clear and functional link while maintaining a consistent design language.
