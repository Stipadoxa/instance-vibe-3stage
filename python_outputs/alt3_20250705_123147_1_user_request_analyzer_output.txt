Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain with product discovery
User Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products within an e-commerce app.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined search experience with large touch targets and quick access to product categories.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Search for specific products, browse products by category.
Secondary Goals: Quickly access different product categories, refine search results (this would likely be on a subsequent screen).
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for slow network conditions, interruptions.
Ready for handoff if: Search bar is clearly visible and easily accessible within the app bar, tabs are clearly labeled and easily tappable, scrolling is smooth and responsive, and a loading indicator is present when data is being fetched.

Content Requirements
Critical: Search bar within app bar, scrollable tabs labeled "electronics," "home goods," and "vehicles."  Product listings (presumably displayed based on tab selection, potentially a subsequent screen).
Supporting:  Option to filter or sort products (likely a secondary screen).
Contextual: Loading indicator while fetching product data for a tab, error message if data cannot be retrieved.

Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** App bar containing search bar.  Scrollable tab layout below the app bar for category selection.  Scrollable list of products below the tabs.
*   **Components:** AppBar (contains search bar), Scrollable Tabs ("electronics," "home goods," "vehicles"), Product List (this would require further specification - likely another screen or detailed requirements document).
*   **Styling:**  This requires further specification.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Perform a search, select a product category.
Secondary Actions: (To be defined in a subsequent screen/documentation - e.g., filtering, sorting, viewing a product's details)
Screen States: Default state (showing all tabs), loading state (while fetching product data), error state (if data cannot be loaded).
Feedback Needs: Loading indicator for data retrieval, clear visual feedback of the currently selected tab, error message if product data is unavailable.
