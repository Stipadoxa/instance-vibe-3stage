  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users require concise information presentation due to screen size limitations; touch interaction is primary; interruptions are common; location awareness is not directly relevant to this screen.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, understand notification content (title, description), and potentially take action based on the notification.\nSecondary Goals: Quickly assess notification importance based on visual cues (avatar, timestamp), navigate to related content from within the notification.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch interaction, potential interruptions during notification review.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar, bottom navigation elements.\nSupporting:  Number of unread notifications (badge or counter).\nContextual:  Indicator of notification action status (e.g., read/unread status).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Top bar (containing user info, potentially a \"settings\" icon), Notification Item Component (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation (with appropriate icons and labels).\n* Styling:  Appropriate styling for avatars, text sizes, and spacing to ensure readability and visual hierarchy within the constraints of a mobile screen.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification item).\nSecondary Actions:  Navigate to other sections of the app via bottom navigation.\nScreen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of read/unread status for notifications.\n",
