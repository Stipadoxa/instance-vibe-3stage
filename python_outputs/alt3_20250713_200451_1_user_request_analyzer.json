Access help or support if needed.  Securely manage sensitive information (password).\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are represented using provided design system components, navigation is intuitive and clear,  touch targets meet minimum size requirements, and a consistent visual style is maintained.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (name, profile picture), Business details (if applicable),  Access to Cars45 auction (toggle), \"Verified ID\" badge status and explanation,  Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats, Disable Feedback, Manage notifications, Change password, Delete account, Log out.\nSupporting:  Clear labels and descriptions for each setting.\nContextual:  Success/failure feedback after setting changes, loading indicators where applicable.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  A vertically scrolling list of settings, similar to the reference image.  Each setting should be presented as a distinct row with clear labels and appropriate interactive elements (toggle switches, input fields, etc.).  Use the provided design system's list component.\n* Components: Utilize components from the provided design system to create the settings list, including list items, toggle switches, input fields, buttons (as appropriate for each setting), and any necessary explanatory text components.\n* Styling: Adhere to the existing color scheme and style guidelines of the design system.  Maintain consistent visual hierarchy and spacing as observed in the reference image.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Modify settings, Log out, Delete Account.\nSecondary Actions:  Navigate to help/support, access individual setting detail pages (where applicable).\nScreen States: Default (all settings displayed),  Loading (while settings are being saved), Success (after successful setting change), Error (if settings cannot be saved).\nFeedback Needs:  Real-time visual feedback on setting changes (e.g., toggles updating their state), Success/failure messages for major actions (e.g., password change), loading indicators during saving.\n",
