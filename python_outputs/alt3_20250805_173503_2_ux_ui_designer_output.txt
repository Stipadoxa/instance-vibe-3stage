I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout for a clear top-to-bottom flow.  Each input field and button occupies its own horizontal space, utilizing `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to ensure they span the full width of the screen for a modern, clean look.  The "Forgot Password?" link is placed below the login button, maintaining visual hierarchy and providing clear next steps.  Consistent spacing of 16 pixels is used between elements.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward: The user enters their email and password, then clicks the login button. If they forget their password, they can click the "Forgot Password?" link to initiate the password recovery process.

4. **Component Choices:**
    - I chose the `10:8492` ("text input") component for the email and password fields because it provides built-in placeholder text, input validation capabilities, and a consistent look and feel with other form elements in the design system. I considered `10:8619` ("text area") but it is not suitable for single-line inputs.
    - I chose the `10:3907` ("Button") component for the login button because it provides a clear call to action and follows the design system's button styles.  I considered no alternatives as a primary button is crucial.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for secure password input masking.  To address this gap, I've used the `10:8492` ("text input") component with a  `native-text` element overlayed as a workaround to indicate visual security. This provides a visually secure entry field while not violating design system guidelines or using a forbidden native component.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established through the vertical layout, size, and color. The primary call to action ("Login" button) is visually prominent using the design system's primary color. The labels are clear and concise, and the "Forgot Password?" link is subtly styled in a secondary color to avoid overshadowing primary actions.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**
    - For the `10:8492` ("text input") components, I selected the `Type: Filled` and `State: enabled` variants, providing a clear visual indication of the input fields. Alternatives like `State: error` or `State: disabled` are not applicable for this context.
    - For the `10:3907` ("Button") component, I selected the `Size: Medium`, `Type: Filled`, `State: Default`, and `Color: Green` variants for optimal visual appeal and clear user guidance.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  A secure password input requires visual masking, which is not directly supported by the provided components.  Therefore, I used a `native-text` element with a secure input visual (e.g., dots) to fulfil this need. This solution remains compliant with the requirement to maintain the design system and functionality where possible.
