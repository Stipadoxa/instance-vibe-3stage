  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage and view notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display, prioritization of critical information, and touch-based interaction.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient use of space.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read, access the source of the notification (if applicable).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-based interaction, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info and bottom navigation are present and functional; all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction and easily visible.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications; user information in the top bar.\nSupporting:  Notification read/unread status indicator (visual cue).\nContextual:  Error messages (e.g., \"No notifications\"), loading indicator (if fetching notifications).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Top bar (user info), list of notification items (each with avatar, title, description, timestamp), bottom navigation.\n* Styling:  (Not specified, requires further design decisions)\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (potentially by tapping on an item).\nSecondary Actions: Mark notifications as read (potentially implied via interaction).\nScreen States:  Default state (showing notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of read/unread notifications.\n\n",
