  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control for mobile users.\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface and limited screen real estate.  Touch interaction is primary.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Create a new account (sign-up).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction, error states are clearly visible and provide helpful context, primary action (\"Sign in\") is prominent and easily tappable, and all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: \"Your e-mail\" field (pre-filled with \"123@example.ua\"), password field, \"Sign in\" button, \"Sign up\" button.\nSupporting: Error message for password field (\"Please enter your password\"), footnote text (\"By continuing you agree to the Policy and Rules\").\nContextual:  Updated error messages based on password field input (e.g., incorrect password).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column layout with top-to-bottom arrangement of fields, buttons, and footnote.\n* Components:  \"Your e-mail\" text input field (pre-filled), password text input field (with error state), \"Sign in\" primary button, \"Sign up\" text button, footnote text with hyperlink (\"Policy and Rules\").\n* Styling:  \"Sign in\" button should have primary color styling. \"Policy and Rules\" link should be styled with primary color.  Error message text within password field should have clear visual distinction (e.g., red text).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Sign in with email and password.\nSecondary Actions: Sign up for an account.\nScreen States: Default state, error state (password field), potentially a loading state during authentication.\nFeedback Needs: Clear error messages for invalid inputs, visual feedback indicating successful login or navigation to sign-up.\n",
