**SECTIONS:**

1. **Gallery:** Contains a hero image (native-rectangle with IMAGE fill) showcasing the used laptop, followed by a carousel of additional images (`10:7816` component) to allow users to view the product from multiple angles.  This section provides the initial visual appeal and detailed product view.

2. **Essentials:** Displays the product title (native-text), price (native-text), and key specifications (condition, processor, RAM, storage, display – all using the `10:10214` List Item component). This section presents crucial information concisely and clearly.

3. **Purchase:** Includes a prominent "Contact Seller" button (`10:3907` component, large, filled, green) as the primary call to action (CTA). This section facilitates direct interaction with the seller.


**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Section Planning:** The design follows the e-commerce pattern (gallery→essentials→purchase→seller→reviews→related).  I omitted reviews and related sections as they weren't explicitly requested in the user analyzer output.  The structure prioritizes immediate visual impact, essential product information, and a clear path to contact the seller.

3. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical layoutMode for a natural reading flow. Level 1 containers (sections) have padding of 16px for comfortable spacing. The image gallery utilizes a `native-rectangle` with an image fill, conforming to the API and sizing constraints.  Level 2 containers are nested for organization and will auto-size to content.

4. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first sees the appealing product image. Then, key product details and specifications follow, designed to be easily scanned.  The prominent "Contact Seller" button at the bottom guides the user to the next step in the purchase process.

5. **Component Choices:** I chose `10:10214` (List Item) for the specifications over using multiple separate native-text elements for better consistency and visual grouping.  I selected `10:3907` (Button) because it provides a standard, well-styled CTA button that will perform well across platforms.

6. **Component Gaps:** The request doesn't include a rating component for the seller's profile. There is a provided avatar component (`24:10352`) which I've used to display the seller profile picture and name, alongside native-text for the seller's details.  A rating component would have been ideal but is missing from the design system.

7. **Visual Hierarchy:** The product title and price are given the largest font sizes to establish prominence.  The visuals are prominent at the top, essential details are clearly labelled, with the CTA button acting as a clear ending point to the flow.

8. **Variant Selection Rationale:** I chose the "2+ images" variant for the `10:7816` (IMAGES) component because the user request specified multiple product photos.  For the button, I chose the "Large", "Filled", "Green", and "Default" variants for maximum visual prominence and clear indication of the main action. I chose the "1-line" variant for list items to keep the specs concise.

9. **Native Element Justification:** Native `native-text` elements were used for the product title and price, and `native-rectangle` with an image fill is used for the product image(s), as these are not effectively represented by the existing components in the design system.  No other native elements are necessary, given the availability of suitable components.
