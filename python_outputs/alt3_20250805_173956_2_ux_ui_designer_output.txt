I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to present information in a clear, sequential manner.  The email and password fields are stacked vertically, followed by the login button and "Forgot Password" link.  Spacing between elements is consistent and utilizes default `itemSpacing` of the root container.  All elements use `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to ensure they span the full width of the screen, adapting responsively to different screen sizes.


3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward:  the user enters their email and password, then taps the login button. If they forget their password, they tap the "Forgot Password" link which will lead to password recovery flow (not implemented here).

4. **Component Choices:**
    * **`10:3907` (Button):** I chose the `Button` component over using native elements because it provides a consistent, platform-aware button style that adheres to the design system and provides built-in accessibility features and states. Variants used are `Platform: "Android+Web"`, `Size: "Medium"`, `Type: "Filled"`, `State: "Default"`, `Color: "Green"`.  It is the most suitable default option to meet the required login button.
    * **`10:8492` (TextInput):**  For both email and password input fields, I've chosen the `text input` component. This provides a consistent and accessible input style. Variants used for both are `Type: "Filled"`, `State: "enabled"`.  Alternatives like `native-text` would not provide the necessary input functionality.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a specific component for password masking. I implemented this using a combination of `native-text` for the password input, and an icon component to represent password visibility toggle (this is merely a visual representation; actual implementation of functionality requires additional logic outside of this design specification).   This workaround provides the essential functionality while adhering to design system principles.  Similarly, there is no built-in 'forgot password' functionality, hence a `native-text` element is used as a hyperlink.


6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the vertical stacking of elements, with larger text for headlines and input labels than for supporting text. The login button is the most prominent element, positioned below input fields to emphasize its function.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** I chose the "Medium" size for the button as it provides a good balance between visibility and screen space. The "Filled" button type provides clear visual feedback. The "Default" state is used because it's the initial state. The green color of the "Green" variant conveys a positive action in line with typical login button design patterns.

8. **Native Element Justification:** The password masking functionality and the "Forgot Password" link require features not directly provided by existing design system components. Using `native-text` components allows me to include the necessary visual representation to guide the user experience in this specific area. The Password toggle requires additional logic that's outside of this design spec.
