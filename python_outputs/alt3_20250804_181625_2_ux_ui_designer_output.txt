**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout employs a vertical structure. The hero section, featuring a full-width image carousel, establishes visual prominence. Below, the product details section uses a vertical layout for a clear information hierarchy.  Seller information and a contact button are placed at the bottom to maintain a natural reading flow.  Consistent 16px spacing is used between major sections for visual breathing room.  All images utilize `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to maximize the use of available screen real estate. Text elements use `horizontalSizing: "AUTO"` allowing them to naturally adjust their width.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is designed to be intuitive and straightforward.  Upon entering the page, the hero image carousel captures attention and provides a visual overview of the product. The product title, price, and key attributes are presented prominently for quick assessment.  The detailed description and seller information are positioned to provide more context before prompting the user to contact the seller via a readily accessible button.

4. **Component Choices:**  I chose to use a `native-rectangle` with `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` and an image fill for the product image carousel, as a dedicated image carousel component is not present in the design system. There is a `10:7816` IMAGES component present but it is unsuitable for multiple image handling.  I considered using multiple `native-rectangle` elements for each image but instead chose a more efficient solution with a single carousel component.  This ensures a clean and consistent user experience across multiple devices.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated product image carousel component. To address this, I used a combination of `native-rectangle` elements for image placeholders that will be dynamically populated with multiple images, to provide a visually appealing and functional slideshow. This solution provides the desired multi-image functionality without deviating from the overall design system.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Visual hierarchy is established by using different text sizes and weights as defined in the provided textStyles.  The product title is most prominent, followed by the price, and key attributes. Supporting text is smaller and less prominent, ensuring a clear visual flow guiding the user's attention effectively.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  N/A. There are no specific component variants available in the Design system that are relevant to this use case.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  As mentioned above, the lack of a dedicated image carousel component necessitates the use of `native-rectangle` elements for image placeholders in a carousel fashion. This native element provides the essential functionality of displaying multiple product images in a visually appropriate format, a core requirement for the used laptop detail page.
