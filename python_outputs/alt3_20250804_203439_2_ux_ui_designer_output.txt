I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical `layoutContainer` to arrange the notification settings.  Each notification type is presented as a separate `list-item` component, creating a clear and organized list.  `itemSpacing` is set to 16 for comfortable visual separation between items. Padding is applied within the `list-item` components to create visual breathing room around the text and toggle switches.  The `horizontalSizing` property isn't explicitly needed for the `list-item` component as it will respect the width of its parent container.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user can easily scan the list of notification types, understand each type's function through clear descriptive text, and directly toggle the on/off state using the built-in switch. This straightforward flow minimizes cognitive load and enhances usability.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:10214` ("List item") component for displaying each notification setting because it provides a structured layout for the text and toggle switch combination.  The inclusion of "Leading" and "Trailing" variants allowed me to position an icon (if needed for future expansion) and a toggle switch effectively. I considered using `native-row` with manual spacing, but the `list-item` offers a more visually cohesive approach while maintaining design system consistency.  The `10:9912` ("switch") component offers a straightforward way to implement the toggle switches.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "Notification Settings" component. I used a combination of existing components (`10:10214`, `10:9912`, and `native-text`) to achieve the functionality and appearance of the desired Notification Settings page. This approach allows for a consistent user experience that mirrors other settings within the app.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the vertical list arrangement of `list-item` components. The notification type label is presented as primary text, immediately followed by the toggle switch.  This promotes straightforward understanding and interaction for each setting.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `list-item` component (`10:10214`), the variants are set as follows:  `Condition: "1-line"`, `Leading: "None"`, `Trailing: "Switch"`, `Show overline: "False"`, `Show supporting text: "True"`. "1-line" is selected because the description text will be concise.  `Leading: "None"` is selected as we are not using a leading icon in this design. `Trailing: "Switch"` places the toggle switch in the trailing position.  `Show overline: "False"` and `Show supporting text: "True"` are used for a clean presentation of the description text. The selected state for the `switch` component (`10:9912`) will be dynamically controlled based on user preference.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  Native `native-text` elements are used to display the notification type labels and descriptions, because while text styles exist, they need to be assigned to specific nodes within the `list-item` structure, to guarantee consistent hierarchy across the screen.
