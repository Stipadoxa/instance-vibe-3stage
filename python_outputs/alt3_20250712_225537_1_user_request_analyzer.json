  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Authentication and User Profile Management domain within a mobile application\nUser Type: Registered mobile users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily navigable settings screen with clear, tappable elements due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  Interruptions are likely, so the design should be intuitive and minimize the number of steps required for common tasks.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Modify personal details (phone number, email, language), delete account, log out.\nSecondary Goals: Easy access to all account-related settings and preferences.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, reliance on mobile network connectivity.\nReady for handoff if: All primary actions are clearly presented and easily accessible through large, clearly labeled tap targets.  Navigation is intuitive, and error states are handled gracefully.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details display (current values), \"Change phone number\" option, \"Change email\" option, \"Change language\" option, \"Delete my account permanently\" option, \"Log out\" option.\nSupporting:  A clear indication of the currently selected language.  Version number or other relevant app information.\nContextual: Confirmation dialog before account deletion, loading indicators during data update operations, error messages for invalid inputs.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical list of settings options.  Top app bar, bottom navigation bar.\n* Components: Top app bar (with app icon and title),  List items (each with a setting name and potentially an edit icon or chevron), Bottom navigation bar (with other app sections).\n* Styling:  Adherence to the app's existing style guide (assuming one exists).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Change phone number, change email, change language, delete account, log out.\nSecondary Actions:  Viewing current personal details.\nScreen States: Default (showing settings), loading (during data update), confirmation dialog (before account deletion), error state (for invalid inputs).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear indication of loading or processing, success messages after changes are saved, error messages for invalid inputs, confirmation before permanent account deletion.\n",
