  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options like social login or biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential for security risks.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and sufficient padding exists between elements for touch targets.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area.\nSupporting: Password recovery link,  \"Remember me\" checkbox, social login options (if applicable), account creation link.\nContextual: Security notices (e.g., padlock icon), loading indicator during authentication,  help/support access (link or icon).\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Social login (if applicable), create new account, access help/support.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (incorrect credentials, network error), success state (redirect to next screen).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (visual cues), clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., brief success message).\n",
