  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates efficient layout.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space,  \"Forgot Password?\" text is center-aligned.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button, \"Forgot Password?\" link\nSupporting:  \nContextual: Error messages for invalid credentials\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* **Layout:**  Vertical layout for login form elements.  Containers for username and password input with labels above input fields.\n* **Components:** Username/email text input (Filled, enabled), Password text input (Filled, enabled), Login button (Android+Web, Large, Filled, Default, Green), \"Forgot Password?\" text.\n* **Styling:**  \"Forgot Password?\" text originally left-aligned;  modification requests center alignment.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery\nSecondary Actions: None explicitly defined in the original or modified request.\nScreen States: Default state, loading during authentication, error states for invalid credentials, success confirmation (implied)\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication\n\n\n**Modification Analysis:**\n\nThe modification request is a `Detailed Specification` focusing on a precise visual change.  The core functionality remains the same. The only change needed is to alter the horizontal alignment of the \"Forgot Password?\" text from left to center alignment.  No changes to the existing layout, components, or styling (except for the specified text alignment) are required.\n",
