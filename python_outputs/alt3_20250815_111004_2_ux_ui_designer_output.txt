## SECTION 1: DESIGN RATIONALE

# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied

- **Typography Hierarchy**: The design leverages the design system's typography hierarchy to ensure clear visual communication.  "Title/Medium" is used for the seller's name, providing prominence while remaining subordinate to any higher-level headings in the product listing context. "Body/Medium" is used for the seller rating, as it's supplementary information.

- **Spacing System**:  The `HORIZONTAL` layout container uses `itemSpacing: 8` to create a visually appealing and compact arrangement of the avatar, seller name, and rating. This spacing is chosen for its close relationship between these elements.  No additional padding is added to the container to maintain a compact layout.

- **Component Behavior**:  The design uses a combination of the `avatar / single` component (with the "Photo" variant) for the seller's avatar and native text for the seller's name and rating. If an avatar image is not available, the fallback behavior of the `avatar / single` component will display a default placeholder.  The rating is styled using `Body/Medium` text style to visually integrate within the row.

- **Color Application**: The primary color palette is used sparingly. The seller's name is set to `Neutral/neutral90` for high contrast. The rating text will also use `Neutral/neutral90` for consistency.  The background will default to `White/white100`, ensuring the seller information stands out clearly.  No additional color modifications are necessary.

- **Layout Strategy**: A `HORIZONTAL` `layoutContainer` is used to arrange the avatar, seller name, and rating horizontally, mirroring the natural left-to-right reading pattern. This is the most efficient layout to display the information compactly within a row.


## Domain Context Integration

- **Industry Patterns**: The design follows established e-commerce patterns by prominently displaying seller information (name and rating) alongside a visual representation (avatar). This immediately communicates seller identity and trustworthiness.

- **User Mental Models**: Users expect to quickly identify seller information within a product listing to gauge trustworthiness before committing to a purchase. This design aligns with that user expectation by presenting the crucial data in a clear, accessible manner.

- **Contextual Adaptations**: The design is created as a reusable row component, adaptable to various contexts like product listings or search results.  Its compact nature allows seamless integration into diverse layouts without cluttering the screen.


## Design System Compliance

- **Component Verification**: All componentNodeIds used are verified to exist within the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.
- **Variant Completeness**: The chosen components utilize only variants that are defined and available in the `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.
- **Text Property Mapping**: Text content is mapped using appropriate text styles based on the design system's hierarchy.
- **Schema Adherence**: The JSON structure strictly adheres to the design system's layout structure conventions.

## ‚úÖ ENHANCED VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**üö´ COMPLETION MANDATE (CRITICAL - CHECK FIRST):**

- [x] **ZERO placeholders** - No "placeholder_id", "needs_definition", or "TBD" values (except for `imageUrl` which is a placeholder for real data)
- [x] **NO skeletal structures** - Every component fully defined and complete
- [x] **REAL IDs only** - All componentNodeId values exist in DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA
- [x] **Complete fallbacks** - Missing components replaced with native elements or alternatives (fallback for missing avatar image is handled by the `avatar / single` component)
- [x] **NO explanatory notes** - JSON works without additional comments or manual fixes
- [x] **ALL properties filled** - No null, undefined, or missing required values (except for `imageUrl` which is a placeholder)

**Design System Compliance:**
- [x] All componentNodeIds exist in DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA
- [x] Text properties use exact textLayers names from schema where applicable (native text used for seller name and rating)
- [x] All required variants included with valid values
- [x] Text styles use exact design system names ("Title/Medium", "Body/Medium", etc.)
- [x] **Colors use exact design system names** ("Neutral/neutral90", etc.)
- [x] **Color properties use correct names** (color)

- [x] Spacing uses consistent design system values

**Component Behavior:**
- [x] Icon choices are semantically appropriate for context (Avatar component handles this)
- [x] Variant combinations make sense for use case (Photo variant of avatar component used)
- [x] Visibility overrides serve user context (Not applicable in this case)
- [x] Image fills specified where relevant (`imageUrl` property provided)

## üéØ **CONCRETE VERIFICATION RULES - ADDED**  (All verified)

## ‚ö° **FINAL SUBMISSION RULES - ADDED** (All satisfied)
