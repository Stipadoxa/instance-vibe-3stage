üìù Original User Request:

üìã Analyzed Requirements:
User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account
Secondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable)
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions
Ready for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is visible (or clear path to recovery), form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and all fields are accessible via keyboard navigation for assistive technologies.

üé® Designer Rationale:
{
  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout is a single-column vertical stack, optimizing for mobile screen real estate.  Top-down arrangement prioritizes the login form, followed by the password recovery link.  Sufficient padding is used between components for touch-friendly interaction.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user flow is straightforward: 1. Input credentials, 2. Tap 'Login', 3. Handle success or failure.  Password recovery is easily accessible via a clear link. Error messages are displayed directly below the relevant input field.",
    "componentChoices": "Text input fields are used for username/email and password, providing clear visual cues for input. A 'Button' component is used for the primary login action, ensuring clear visual distinction.  A simple text link is used for password recovery. ",
    "visualHierarchy": "The login button is given the most visual prominence, using a large size and primary color.  The password recovery link is clearly visible and has a secondary emphasis.  The order of elements guides the user through the login process."
  }
}

üîß Engineer Rationale:
{
  "implementationRationale": {
    "componentSelection": "Component IDs from the input were used directly where provided.  For components without IDs (text elements),  `native-text` was selected as the appropriate Figma component.",
    "styleApplication": "Text styles and color styles were applied as specified in the input JSON.  The `colorStyleName` property was used directly where provided to maintain consistency with the design system.",
    "designSystemMapping": "The design system's components and styles were mapped directly to the input specifications.  No interpretation or modification of the design choices was performed.",
    "variantDecisions": "Component variants were selected based on the 'variants' property provided in the input.  Where no variants were specified, default variants were assumed."
  }
