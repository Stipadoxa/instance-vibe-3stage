Domain & Context
Domain:  Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application.
User Type: Mobile application users who need to manage and view their notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display of information, prioritization of critical notifications, and consideration of touch interactions. Limited screen real estate requires efficient use of space.


User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals: Potentially mark notifications as read, potentially dismiss notifications.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices, need for clear and concise notification display, potential for many notifications.
Ready for handoff if:  Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all content is legible and touch targets are appropriately sized.


Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications; user information in top bar; bottom navigation items.
Supporting:  Notification read status indicator (e.g., bold or faded text).
Contextual:  Indication of unread notifications count (perhaps in the top bar or bottom navigation).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.
* Components: Top bar (containing user info - possibly profile picture and name), individual notification items (each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp), bottom navigation (with multiple tabs).
* Styling:  Consider clear visual hierarchy to distinguish between read and unread notifications.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification item).
Secondary Actions: Mark notifications as read, dismiss notifications.  Actions might be implicit (tap to mark as read) or explicit (separate button).
Screen States: Default state (showing notifications), potentially a loading state (if fetching notifications), and an empty state (no notifications).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual indicators for read/unread notifications, appropriate feedback when a notification is marked as read or dismissed.
