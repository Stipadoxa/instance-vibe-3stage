Navigation bars should adhere to existing app guidelines.\n* Styling:  Adhere to the existing app's color palette and typography. Maintain visual consistency with the rest of the app.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Tap on settings options to modify settings, tap on \"Log out\" to end the session.\nSecondary Actions: Access help information for individual settings.\nScreen States: Default state displaying all settings, loading state (if applicable during setting changes), success and error states after action completion.\nFeedback Needs: Visual confirmation (e.g., checkmarks or updated text) after successful setting changes, clear error messages for invalid inputs or failed actions, loading indicators when appropriate.\n\n",
