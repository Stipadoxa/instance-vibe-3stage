Clear visual separation between list items.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Modify settings, Log out, Delete Account\nSecondary Actions:  Access help/information for individual settings.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (if applicable, e.g., while saving changes), error state (if applicable).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of saved changes, loading indicators during long operations, error messages for invalid inputs.\n",
