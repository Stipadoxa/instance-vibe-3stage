Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile app access
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a simple, secure, and touch-friendly login experience.  Screen real estate is limited, and users may be in distracting environments.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Securely authenticate and access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media logins for faster access, recover forgotten passwords.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) have appropriately sized touch targets, error messages are clearly displayed, and the password recovery flow is functional.


Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, password recovery link.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google),  Terms & Conditions footnote.
Contextual: Error messages (incorrect credentials, network issues), loading indicators.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single-column layout for fields, buttons, and links.  Social media buttons should be grouped.
* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button ("Log In"), multiple social login buttons, a link for "Password Recovery", and a footnote for T&C acceptance.
* Styling: (To be determined based on provided visual reference.  Referencing the example image, a clean and simple layout with clear visual hierarchy is suggested.)

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Log in with credentials, initiate password recovery
Secondary Actions: Log in via social media
Screen States: Default, loading, error (incorrect credentials, network), success (redirect to app home).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation of email/username format, clear error messages for invalid inputs, loading indicators during authentication.
