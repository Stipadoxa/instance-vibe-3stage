  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile app users needing to access their accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick and secure access with a touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Log in using social media accounts, recover forgotten passwords.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if:  All interactive elements (fields, buttons, links) have sufficient tap targets for mobile use, error states are defined and visually distinct,  password recovery and terms & conditions links are clearly visible and accessible.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (specify platforms), password recovery link.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication.  Footnote indicating acceptance of Terms & Conditions upon login.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single-column layout optimized for mobile. Fields stacked vertically above buttons.\n* Components:  Text input fields (username/email, password),  primary button (\"Login\"), secondary buttons (Social Media Logins - specify platforms), link (\"Forgot Password?\"), footnote (\"By logging in, you agree to our Terms & Conditions\").\n* Styling:  Consider platform-consistent styling guidelines.  Ensure sufficient spacing between elements for touch interaction.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Social media login.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (incorrect credentials), success state (redirect to app).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format (if applicable), clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.\n",
