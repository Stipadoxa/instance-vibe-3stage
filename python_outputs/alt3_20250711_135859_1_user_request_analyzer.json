Note the lack of styling directives in the user request.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Sign in\nSecondary Actions: Sign up\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirection to account)\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format (if applicable), clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.\n",
