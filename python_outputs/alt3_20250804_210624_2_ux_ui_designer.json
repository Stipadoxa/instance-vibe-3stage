The search bar occupies full width at the top, followed by a filter button. The product cards are arranged in a grid layout, automatically adjusting to available space.  Horizontal spacing between elements is maintained for readability. Full-width images within product cards are achieved using `horizontalSizing: \"FILL\"` in the `native-rectangle` element.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first encounters the search bar to initiate a product search.  They can then refine results using the filter button. The grid display allows for efficient browsing of product results. Each product card provides essential details, leading to more information on selection.\n\n4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `147:3743` (product card) component for displaying product information. I considered using a custom layout for the product grid; however, the provided `product card` (147:3743) component adequately fulfilled the requirements while maintaining design system consistency.  I did not use a separate image component because 147:3743 already incorporates an image placeholder, making the design more streamlined.  The `10:8492` (text input) component is used for the search bar. No other input component was needed since this satisfied the requirements. The `10:3907` (button) component is a suitable choice for the filter button.\n\n\n5. **Component Gaps:**  The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying product cards in a grid layout, and a dedicated search bar that fits within the appbar.  The workaround is created using the `product card` (147:3743) component to represent individual products, with a grid layout implemented using a `native-layoutContainer` with `layoutMode: \"HORIZONTAL\"` and `layoutWrap: \"WRAP\"`. The searchbar is created by using the `10:12086` component, and is nested within the appbar component. This provides a flexible and responsive layout while adhering to the overall design system.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The search bar is prominently displayed at the top, establishing it as the primary interaction point.  Product cards are given secondary prominence, clearly organized.  The filter button is placed next to the searchbar which helps with the hierarchy of actions.  Text within the product cards follows a clear hierarchy based on design system text styles.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:3907` (button) component representing the Filter button, I've selected the `variants: { \"Size\": \"Medium\", \"Type\": \"Filled\", \"State\": \"Default\", \"Color\": \"Green\" }` because a medium-sized button is visually appealing, \"Filled\" type stands out well against the background, \"Default\" state shows the active state, and green signifies action and is a common color for filters.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:** To achieve the product card grid layout,  I used a `native-layoutContainer` with `layoutMode: \"HORIZONTAL\"` and `layoutWrap: \"WRAP\"` because no dedicated grid component is available in the design system. This native element allows for automatic wrapping and responsive adjustment of product cards, ensuring an optimal user experience on different screen sizes.\n\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Product Listing\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 0,\n    \"paddingBottom\": 0,\n    \"paddingLeft\": 0,\n    \"paddingRight\": 0,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:5620\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Mode\": \"Light\",\n          \"Type\": \"search-field\",\n          \"Elevation\": \"flat\"\n        },\n        \"items\":[\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:12086\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Device\": \"Mobile\",\n              \"State\": \"default\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n        \"paddingTop\": 16,\n        \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n        \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n        \"paddingRight\": 16,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n              \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n              \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n              \"State\": \"Default\",\n              \"Color\": \"Green\"\n            },\n            \"properties\":{\n              \"textLayers\":{\n                \"Action\":\"Filter\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"layoutGrow\": 1,\n        \"layoutWrap\": \"WRAP\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n        \"paddingTop\": 16,\n        \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n        \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n        \"paddingRight\": 16,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
