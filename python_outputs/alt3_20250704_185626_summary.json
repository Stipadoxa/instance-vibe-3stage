      "content": "Domain & Context\n\nDomain: E-commerce domain, specifically a mobile marketplace for product discovery and purchase.\nUser Type: Mobile users looking to buy and sell products within a specific geographic area (indicated by the \"location\" filter).  This implies a local marketplace context.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined, intuitive interface with large touch targets, efficient navigation, and quick loading times. Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of information and efficient use of space.  Location awareness is crucial for the \"location\" filter.\n\n\nUser Requirements\n\nPrimary Goals:  Find relevant products quickly and easily, understand product details clearly, initiate contact with sellers.\nSecondary Goals: Save preferred products for later viewing, filter search results effectively, sell products through the app.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potentially unreliable network connectivity, interruptions during use.\n\n\nReady for handoff if:  The search bar is prominently displayed and easy to access, product cards are consistently sized and visually appealing with clear price and location information, filters are easily applied and removed, and all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes.\n\n\nContent Requirements\n\nCritical: Product photos, product titles, prices (with currency KSh), location of seller, seller contact information (possibly implicit).\nSupporting: Discount percentages, number of results, seller ratings/reviews (if available), category icons, filter options (location, brand, etc.).\nContextual:  Loading indicators, error messages (e.g., no results found), filter chip states (active/inactive), saved product indicators.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\n\nPrimary Actions: Search for products, filter results, view product details, contact seller.\nSecondary Actions: Save product, toggle view (e.g., grid/list), sort results, access app navigation (bottom nav).\nScreen States: Default (search results), loading state, no results state, filter applied state, product details view.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on filter application, real-time search results updates, loading indicators during search and data retrieval, confirmation of actions (saving, contacting seller).\n",

Its placement at the top ensures immediate accessibility.  The default state variant is appropriate for initial screen load.\n\n* **Filter Chip (10:8132):** Location filtering is a key feature given the local marketplace context.  The filter chip provides a clear visual indicator of the active filter (\"Nairobi\" is a placeholder – real location data would be dynamic). The \"selected\" style highlights its active status.\n\n* **Product Listing (147:3743):** A grid view (`view: \"grid\"`) is ideal for efficient product display on mobile, allowing users to see multiple products at a glance.  The `type: \"normal\"` variant suggests standard product card display.  I've replaced the placeholder content with realistic examples.  Image placeholders are used because real images would be fetched dynamically.\n\n* **Bottom Navigation (10:4724):** Bottom navigation ensures easy access to secondary actions like saved items, selling, and profile, enhancing user flow and minimizing navigation overhead.  Labels are clear and concise.\n\n**Missing Components and Considerations:**\n\nThis JSON represents a simplified version of the initial screen.  Further refinement would include:\n\n* **Loading Indicators:**  A loading indicator (component ID not provided) should be added during search and data retrieval for a better user experience.  The `snackbar` component could be used for this.\n\n* **No Results State:**  A message informing users that no products match their search criteria is essential (using a `snackbar` or a dedicated text component).\n\n* **Product Detail View:**  The design system data lacks details of a product card.  A separate JSON object should be created for the product detail view to reflect this.\n\n* **Seller Contact:**  The method for contacting sellers (e.g., a button, in-app messaging) needs to be specified.  The `button` component (10:3907) could be used.\n\n* **Sorting and View Toggling:**  Components for sorting (e.g., dropdown) and toggling between list and grid view need to be added and would need component IDs from design system data.\n\n\nThis response provides a foundational structure.  A fully fleshed-out interface would require more iterations and incorporate more components and states based on user testing and requirements.\n",

External padding is added to the main container and sections for spacing.\n\n* **Icon/Text Properties:** The prompt's guidance on icon and text properties is followed. Since the provided design specs don't detail specific icon usage in components like the list item, I’ve assumed no icons in the initial implementation.  More specific details would allow for a more accurate rendering.\n\n* **1px Width Prevention:**  The prompt's rules for preventing 1px width elements are followed.  While the provided design specs don't include `native-text` components, the structure is ready to accept and handle them correctly if added.  `horizontalSizing: \"FILL\"` and `textAutoResize: \"HEIGHT\"` are employed where appropriate.\n\n* **Component Mapping:** Component IDs from the design specs are used where available (`10:12086`, `10:8132`, `147:3743`, `10:4724`).  Placeholder values are used for content where specifics were absent (e.g., image URLs for products).  The `list` component's `properties` are adapted to the likely structure needed for rendering product cards.\n\n* **Missing Elements:** The JSON reflects my understanding of the design specification and includes a placeholder structure for where more detailed specifications were needed.  This highlights areas where the provided design system data needs to be fleshed out.  Features like loading states, error handling, and more detailed product card information would be added in a fully functional plugin.\n\n\nThis improved JSON is more robust and adheres closely to best practices for Figma plugin development based on the given specifications and guidelines.  Remember that this is a starting point, and additional iterations are required to refine the JSON based on complete component specifications and user requirements.\n",
