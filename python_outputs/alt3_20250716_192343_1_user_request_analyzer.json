  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile app user registration\nUser Type: New mobile app users creating accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined registration process with minimal steps, large touch targets, and potentially interrupted sessions.  The design must be visually appealing within the constraints of a mobile screen.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Create a new user account successfully.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social login options for faster registration, receive confirmation of successful account creation.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions, potential for typos on small keyboard.\nReady for handoff if: All form fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction, error messages are clearly visible, social login buttons are functional and visually distinct, and a clear \"Create Account\" button is present and prominent.  The overall design matches the visual style of the provided reference image (while using our components).\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Email address field, password field, first name field, last name field, phone number field, \"Create Account\" button.\nSupporting: \"Continue with Google\" button, \"Continue with Facebook\" button,  \"Avoid disclosing your password to anyone\" disclaimer, Terms and Conditions link, Privacy Policy link.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid inputs, loading indicator during account creation, success message upon successful account creation.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical layout of form fields, social login buttons above the form fields.\n* Components:  Use existing app components for input fields, buttons (including social login buttons), and disclaimers/links.  The visual style should match the reference image.\n* Styling:  Match the dark color scheme and visual style of the reference image.  Ensure consistent button styles and visual hierarchy.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Create account using form fields, create account using social login.\nSecondary Actions: View Terms and Conditions, view Privacy Policy.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (invalid inputs), success state.\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength, clear error messages for invalid inputs, loading indicator during account creation, and success confirmation message.\n",
