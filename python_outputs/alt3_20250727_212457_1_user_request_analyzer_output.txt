Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.
Platform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates concise notification display.  Touch interaction is primary; design must accommodate finger-sized tap targets.  Users may be interrupted, requiring clear and concise information delivery.


User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications; understand the content of each notification (who it's from, what it's about, when it was sent).
Secondary Goals:  Quickly assess the importance of each notification; potentially take action based on notification content (though actions themselves are not specified in this request and would require further elaboration).
User Constraints: Limited screen space; reliance on touch input; potential for interruptions while viewing notifications.
Ready for handoff if:  Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction and are visually distinct from each other.


Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the five notifications), user info in the top bar.
Supporting:  None specified in the request.
Contextual:  Potentially, indicators of unread notifications (though this is not specified).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.
* Components: Top bar (containing user info), Notification Item (containing user avatar, title, description, timestamp - repeated five times), Bottom Navigation.
* Styling:  Not specified in the request.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification item).
Secondary Actions: Navigate to other screens via bottom navigation.
Screen States:  Default state (showing five notifications); potentially a "no notifications" state (not explicitly specified but should be considered).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications (if applicable).  Loading indicator if notifications are fetched asynchronously (if applicable).
