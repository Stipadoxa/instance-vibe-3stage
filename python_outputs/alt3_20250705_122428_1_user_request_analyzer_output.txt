Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain focused on product discovery
User Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products within categorized sections.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined search experience with clear categories and easily accessible results. Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space and touch-friendly interactions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Search for products across different categories, browse products within specific categories.
Secondary Goals: Quickly access different product categories, refine search results (future consideration).
User Constraints: Limited screen size, reliance on touch interaction, potential for interruptions.

Content Requirements
Critical: Search bar, scrollable tabs ("electronics", "home goods", "vehicles"), product listings (populated based on search and category).
Supporting:  Category icons (for visual clarity), potentially a filter option (future consideration).
Contextual: Loading indicators during search, error messages for no results, product details upon selection.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: AppBar with search bar, scrollable tab layout for category navigation, vertically scrolling list of products below tabs.
* Components: AppBar (with search bar), Scrollable TabView ("electronics", "home goods", "vehicles"), Product List (displaying product images, titles, and potentially prices).
* Styling:  Adherence to platform-specific design guidelines (e.g., Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Perform a search, select a product category.
Secondary Actions:  (Potentially) filter results, access account or cart.
Screen States: Default state (showing tabs and potentially featured products), loading state (during search or category change), error state (no results).
Feedback Needs:  Visual feedback on search input, loading indicators, clear display of selected category, error messages for failed searches.

Ready for handoff if: Search bar is functional, tabs are correctly labeled and scrollable, product listings are displayed correctly, and loading and error states are designed.
