Domain & Context
Domain: General UI domain with interactive elements
User Type: Mobile users interacting with a simple button element.
Platform Impact: Mobile users rely on touch interaction; the button must be large enough for easy tapping and visually distinct from the surrounding content.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Initiate an action by tapping the button.
Secondary Goals:  Provide clear visual feedback upon interaction.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for accidental taps.
Ready for handoff if: The button has a minimum tappable area of 44 x 44 pixels (or adheres to platform guidelines), clear visual indication of its interactive nature (e.g., through styling and hover/pressed states), and sufficient contrast against the background.

Content Requirements
Critical:  Button label (text or icon) clearly indicating its function.
Supporting:  None
Contextual:  Potentially loading indicator if the button initiates a lengthy process.

Structural & Component Directives

* Layout:  Standalone button element.
* Components:  Single button with label.
* Styling:  Button should adhere to platform design guidelines for mobile.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Tap the button to trigger the intended action.
Secondary Actions: None (for a simple button).
Screen States: Default (untapped), Pressed (tapped), Potentially Disabled (if applicable).
Feedback Needs:  Visual feedback upon tap (e.g., change in color, shape, or a brief animation).
