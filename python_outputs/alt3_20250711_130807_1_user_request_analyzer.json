  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account\nSecondary Goals: Create a new account, recover forgotten credentials\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions\nReady for handoff if: \"Sign in\" button is most prominent, \"Sign up\" button is clearly secondary, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  \"Welcome\" title, email field, password field, \"Sign in\" button, \"Sign up\" button\nSupporting: Password recovery link (consider placement for optimal discoverability),  placeholder text for email and password fields.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column layout to maximize vertical space utilization on mobile.\n* Components:  Header containing \"Welcome\" title, input fields for email and password (consider secure input types), \"Sign in\" button (primary, prominent styling), \"Sign up\" button (text-only, secondary styling).\n* Styling:  Consider using platform-consistent styling guidelines for buttons and input fields to maintain a familiar user experience.  \"Sign in\" button should have clear visual prominence (e.g., bolder color, larger size).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials\nSecondary Actions: Sign up for an account\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (during authentication), error state (for invalid credentials)\nFeedback Needs:  Real-time validation for email format, clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.\n",
