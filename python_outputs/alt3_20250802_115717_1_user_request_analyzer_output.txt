While a fully expressive design might be overkill, enhancing the default design system components with subtle animations, improved image presentation, and a thoughtfully designed 'Contact Seller' button will improve conversion rates and create a more positive user experience.  The balance is key: maintain ease of use while leveraging the opportunity to showcase the product and build trust with the seller."
