Domain & Context
Domain:  Authentication and User Profile Management domain within a mobile application
User Type: Registered mobile users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily navigable settings screen with clear, tappable elements due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  Interruptions are likely, so the design should be intuitive and minimize the number of steps required for common tasks.


User Requirements
Primary Goals:  Modify personal details (phone number, email, language), delete account, log out.
Secondary Goals: Easy access to all account-related settings and preferences.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, reliance on mobile network connectivity.
Ready for handoff if: All primary actions are clearly presented and easily accessible through large, clearly labeled tap targets.  Navigation is intuitive, and error states are handled gracefully.


Content Requirements
Critical: Personal details display (current values), "Change phone number" option, "Change email" option, "Change language" option, "Delete my account permanently" option, "Log out" option.
Supporting:  A clear indication of the currently selected language.  Version number or other relevant app information.
Contextual: Confirmation dialog before account deletion, loading indicators during data update operations, error messages for invalid inputs.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical list of settings options.  Top app bar, bottom navigation bar.
* Components: Top app bar (with app icon and title),  List items (each with a setting name and potentially an edit icon or chevron), Bottom navigation bar (with other app sections).
* Styling:  Adherence to the app's existing style guide (assuming one exists).


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Change phone number, change email, change language, delete account, log out.
Secondary Actions:  Viewing current personal details.
Screen States: Default (showing settings), loading (during data update), confirmation dialog (before account deletion), error state (for invalid inputs).
Feedback Needs:  Clear indication of loading or processing, success messages after changes are saved, error messages for invalid inputs, confirmation before permanent account deletion.
