I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs referenced below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout (`layoutMode`: "VERTICAL") to present information in a clear, sequential manner.  Components are spaced using default `itemSpacing` of 0 to ensure a clean and uncluttered look. Padding is also set to 0 at the root level to avoid unnecessary whitespace.  Each input field and button occupies the full width of its container (`horizontalSizing`: "FILL") for a consistent mobile-first design.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward: The user enters their email address, then their password, and finally taps the "Login" button.  The "Forgot Password?" link provides an alternative path for users who have forgotten their credentials.  The visual hierarchy and order of elements is designed to guide the user through this simple flow smoothly.

4. **Component Choices:**

    * **Input Fields:** I chose `10:8492` (text input) over potentially using a custom `native-text` element combined with other native elements to build a more complex text input for better design system consistency and built-in features such as placeholder text and error handling.
    * **Login Button:** I chose `10:3907` (Button) with `variants`: {"Size": "Medium", "Type": "Filled", "Color": "Green", "State": "Default"} over using a `native-rectangle` with text because it provides a standardized button appearance and interaction across the app, ensuring consistency with the design system.
    * **Forgot Password Link:**  There is no direct component for a simple link, so I opted for a `native-text` element styled as a hyperlink. This allows for basic link functionality without deviating significantly from the design system.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system does not contain a dedicated "Login Screen" component. However, the core components identified and the use of native elements provide a flexible, complete login screen. The current strategy fulfills the user requirements while remaining consistent with the design system principles.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Visual hierarchy is established through the vertical stacking of the elements:  email input, password input, login button, and forgot password link. This natural order implies priority and flow.  The size of the button makes it visually prominent. The label of the input fields guides users to input their information.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**

    * **Button Variants:**  The button is using `"Size": "Medium"` for balance, `"Type": "Filled"` for clear emphasis, `"Color": "Green"` to convey a positive action, and `"State": "Default"` for the initial state.
    * **Input Field Variants:** The input field components use `"Type": "Filled"` and `"State": "enabled"` variants to make the input fields more prominent.

8. **Native Element Justification:** Since there are no components for hyperlink functionality or password visibility toggles in the provided design system, I utilized `native-text` for the "Forgot Password?" link, styling it as a hyperlink.  For the password visibility toggle, I will use `635:4518` (icon/eye) and `635:4528` (icon/cancel) to represent visible and invisible states, respectively, within the password input field.
