  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user profile management and account settings\nUser Type: Mobile users managing their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily navigable settings screen due to limited screen real estate.  Touch interactions will be primary, and the design must account for interruptions and varying network conditions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal and business details, manage notification preferences, change account security settings, and log out of the application.\nSecondary Goals:  Easily find and access specific settings, understand the consequences of actions like deleting an account.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile devices, reliance on touch interactions, potential for interruptions, varying network connectivity.\nReady for handoff if: All listed settings are accessible and functional, top and bottom app bars are implemented, and clear labels and visual feedback are provided for each setting.  Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (view/edit), Business details (view/edit), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats, Disable feedback, Manage notifications, Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  Clear labels for each setting, confirmation prompts for destructive actions (account deletion), and tooltips or help icons for clarification where needed.\nContextual:  Success/error messages after changes are saved, loading indicators for actions that require network requests.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single column list of settings, potentially grouped by category (Personal, Business, Account, etc.). Top app bar for navigation/back button. Bottom app bar for persistent navigation (if applicable).\n* Components:  Each setting will likely be presented as a list item with a label and an action (e.g., tap to edit, toggle switch).\n* Styling:  Consistent styling with the rest of the application.  Use clear visual cues to differentiate between settings categories if grouped.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Edit personal/business details, change settings (phone number, email, language, etc.), disable chats/feedback, manage notifications, change password, delete account, log out.\nSecondary Actions:  Access help or support information (potentially linked from a settings item or top app bar).\nScreen States: Default state (showing settings list), editing states for specific settings, confirmation dialogs for account deletion and other destructive actions, loading states for network requests, success/error states after saving changes.\nFeedback Needs:  Visual confirmation of changes (e.g., checkmarks), clear error messages, loading indicators for saving changes, and appropriate confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.\n",
