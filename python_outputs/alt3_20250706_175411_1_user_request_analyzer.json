  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (e.g., social login, biometric authentication if appropriate for the context).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential for typos due to touch keyboard.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is clearly visible and accessible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space and are clearly presented, and all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area.\nSupporting: Password recovery link,  \"Remember me\" checkbox (optional, depending on security requirements and user preferences),  social login options (if applicable).\nContextual: Loading indicator during authentication,  specific error messages for invalid credentials (e.g., \"Incorrect username or password\"), security notices (e.g., secure connection indicator).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Social login (if applicable), create new account (link to registration screen), access help/support (link to relevant page).\nScreen States: Default state (form fields displayed), loading state (indicator visible), error state (error messages displayed), success state (redirection to the user's account or relevant page).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (visual cues), clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n",
