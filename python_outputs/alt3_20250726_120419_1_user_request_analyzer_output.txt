Domain & Context
Domain: Healthcare domain with secure messaging and alert system (assuming "classified app" refers to a secure healthcare application).
User Type: Healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, etc.) receiving critical and non-critical updates via the application.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need quick access to information, clear visual hierarchy due to screen size limitations, and potential for interruptions.  Touch interactions are primary.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View important notifications, understand notification urgency and content.
Secondary Goals:  Quickly access relevant information within each notification, discern the age of notifications.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for distractions and interruptions, need for clear and concise information.
Ready for handoff if:  All five notification list items are displayed correctly, including image, title, subtitle, and timestamp. Top app bar and bottom navigation are present and functional.  Visual hierarchy clearly distinguishes notification urgency (if applicable).

Content Requirements
Critical: List of 5 notifications (image, title, subtitle, timestamp for each).
Supporting:  Visual indicator of unread notifications (if applicable).
Contextual:  Loading indicator if notifications are still being fetched, error message if notifications cannot be loaded.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for 5 notifications.  Each list item contains an image, title, subtitle, and timestamp.
* Components: Top app bar (with appropriate title and actions), notification list (with scrollable content if more than 5 notifications exist in a larger data set), bottom navigation bar (with appropriate icons and labels).
* Styling:  Consider using color-coding to indicate notification priority or urgency (e.g., red for critical, yellow for important, etc.).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  View details of a selected notification (tapping a list item).
Secondary Actions:  Mark a notification as read (e.g., via a swipe action).
Screen States:  Default state (showing the list of notifications), loading state, error state (if notifications fail to load).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of which notification is selected.  Feedback on actions (e.g., visual cue when a notification is marked as read).
