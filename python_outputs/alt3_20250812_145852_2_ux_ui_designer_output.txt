## SECTION 1: DESIGN RATIONALE

# Design Rationale for Used Laptop Product Page (Mobile-First)

This document outlines the design rationale for a mobile-first product page for a used laptop listing on an e-commerce marketplace.  The design leverages a pre-existing design system to ensure consistency and efficiency.  The primary goal is to provide potential buyers with comprehensive information, facilitating informed purchase decisions and easy contact with the seller.

### Component Intelligence Applied

**Typography Hierarchy:**  The design employs a clear typographic hierarchy to guide the user's eye and prioritize information.  Primary text styles (22-24px, weight 500-600) are used for the main product title, immediately establishing the core offering. Secondary text (18-20px, weight 500) is reserved for key information like price and seller details, providing clear visual separation from the main title. Tertiary text (14-16px, weight 400) is used for the product description, specifications, and other supporting content. This system ensures readability and prioritization of information.


**Spacing System:**  The design system's spacing tokens are meticulously implemented to create visual harmony and improve readability.  `itemSpacing` values of 8px and 12px are used for related content within sections, while 16px and 20px provide separation between major sections.  Internal padding within components adheres to the design system's recommendations for optimal touch target sizes and visual balance.  For example, content containers use 16px horizontal and 16-20px vertical padding, ensuring sufficient space around content without excessive whitespace.


**Component Behavior:**  The design leverages various components from the design system, tailoring their variants to meet specific contextual needs.  For instance, "Contact Seller" and "Add to Wishlist" buttons utilize the `Button` component with a `Primary + Large` variant for prominence. Seller profile information is displayed using the `avatar` component showing both profile picture and rating. Product images use the `IMAGES` component, accommodating multiple images and providing placeholder behavior if no image is available. Visibility overrides are used to hide less relevant elements or actions in certain circumstances.  The `List item` component is used to present detailed specifications, adapting the variants (`2-line + None + None`) to accommodate the laptop’s attributes and values.


**Color Application:**  The design consistently utilizes design system color tokens.  High contrast (#28363e) is used for primary text, creating clear legibility. Medium contrast (#6c8ea0) is used for secondary and tertiary text and labels.  Primary action buttons are styled with the primary color token (`#00b53f`) to stand out, while other elements use the appropriate neutral shades. This consistent approach reinforces brand identity and maintains visual consistency.


**Layout Strategy:**  A vertical layout is primarily used for the main content flow, reflecting natural reading patterns.  The layout mode for the primary content is `VERTICAL` using `itemSpacing` of 12px for readability, and `layoutAlign` of `STRETCH` for filling the container's width.  Horizontal layouts are implemented for the list of product images. The responsiveness is addressed by carefully selecting components, setting appropriate `horizontalSizing` and `layoutAlign` attributes, and using `WRAP` where needed to achieve a fluid layout for different screen sizes and orientations.


### Domain Context Integration

**Industry Patterns:** The design adheres to established e-commerce conventions, such as prominent product images, clear pricing, concise descriptions, seller information with ratings and reviews, and clear call-to-actions.

**User Mental Models:** The layout is organized in a way that aligns with users' expectations when browsing product pages. Key information (price, condition, seller details) is prominently displayed at the top, followed by more detailed descriptions and specifications.


**Contextual Adaptations:**  Components from the design system have been selected and adapted to work optimally within this specific use case.  For example, while the design system offers various button types, the focus here is on clear and easily identifiable call-to-action buttons.



### Design System Compliance

All component IDs have been validated against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.  The specifications utilize the exact text layer names from the schema.  Appropriate variants and their combinations have been chosen and clearly defined.  Typography and color choices strictly adhere to the design system’s rules.  The detailed JSON specification below reflects strict adherence to the design system's structure and properties.

**Note:**  This JSON structure provides a framework.  Placeholder image URLs and specific component instances for images and specifications need to be added based on the actual data.  This structure prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and ease of implementation by the JSON engineer.  The `textStyleId` and `textColor` properties are directly linked to the design system's defined styles and colors, ensuring consistency.  This approach ensures that the design specification is production-ready and effectively communicates the design intent to the development team.
