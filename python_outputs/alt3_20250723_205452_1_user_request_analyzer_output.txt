Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.
User Type: Mobile application users attempting to access their accounts.
Platform Impact: Mobile users require a streamlined, touch-friendly interface with clear visual hierarchy due to screen size limitations and potential for interruptions.  Design must consider varying network conditions and touch-only interaction.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Securely authenticate and access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize convenient social media login options; recover forgotten credentials.
User Constraints: Small screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) meet minimum touch target size requirements; password recovery and terms & conditions are clearly accessible; error states are defined and visually distinct.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button,  password recovery link, terms & conditions footnote.
Supporting: Social media login buttons.
Contextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials or network issues), loading indicators.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout, with input fields above the primary button, followed by social login buttons and then the password recovery link and T&C footnote.
* Components:  Input fields (username/email, password), Primary button ("Log In"), Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google),  Password recovery link (e.g., "Forgot Password?"), Text indicating acceptance of T&C.  (e.g., "By logging in, you agree to our Terms & Conditions.")
* Styling:  Refer to provided visual reference for styling cues, paying attention to color palette, typography, and spacing.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login using credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Login via social media accounts.
Screen States: Default state (fields visible, buttons enabled), loading state (indicator displayed), error state (relevant error messages displayed), success state (redirect to app).
Feedback Needs: Real-time input validation (for email format and password strength, where applicable), informative error messages, loading indicators.
