  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery within a Mobile Application\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications regarding app activity, updates, or messages.\nPlatform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information display; touch interaction is primary; interruptions are common; location awareness may be relevant depending on notification content.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View incoming notifications, understand notification content (title, subtitle, image), and take appropriate action based on notification type.\nSecondary Goals:  Easily identify the time of each notification; manage notifications (e.g., mark as read, dismiss).\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, limited attention span.\nReady for handoff if: All notification elements (image, title, subtitle, timestamp) are clearly visible and appropriately sized for touch interaction; navigation is intuitive and readily accessible; no overlapping or unreadable content exists.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: List of notifications, each with image, title, subtitle, and timestamp.\nSupporting:  Notification count badge (if applicable), option to mark all as read.\nContextual:  Different visual cues for read vs. unread notifications.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical list of notifications, each with an image on the left and text on the right. Timestamp on the right side. Top app bar at the top. Bottom navigation bar at the bottom.\n*   **Components:** Top app bar with app icon and title, scrollable list of notification items (image, title, subtitle, timestamp), bottom navigation bar with multiple tabs.\n*   **Styling:** Consistent visual style matching the rest of the mobile app. Clear visual separation between notification items.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details, take action based on notification (if applicable).\nSecondary Actions: Mark as read, dismiss notification, access notification settings.\nScreen States: Default (showing list of notifications), Empty state (no notifications), Loading state (fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Visual indication of read/unread notifications, clear visual and/or haptic feedback upon user interaction (e.g., marking as read).\n",
