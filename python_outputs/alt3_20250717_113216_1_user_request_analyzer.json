  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management\nUser Type: Mobile app users managing their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily navigable settings page with touch-friendly controls.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of settings.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage notification preferences, update personal information.\nSecondary Goals:  Understand account status (e.g., \"Verified ID\"), easily log out of the application, delete account if desired.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, limited attention span.\nReady for handoff if: All settings are accessible, navigation is intuitive, and all interactive elements meet mobile touch target guidelines.  The visual style matches the provided reference image while using existing app components.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (name, contact information), business details (if applicable), notification settings, password change, account deletion, logout.\nSupporting: Access to Cars45 auction status, \"Verified ID\" badge explanation,  chat/feedback disabling options.\nContextual:  Confirmation dialogs before deleting the account or performing significant actions.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  List-based layout using vertically stacked rows. Each row represents a setting.  Top and bottom app navigation bars are included.\n* Components:  Use existing app components for list items, buttons, switches (for toggles), and navigation.  The visual style should match the reference image.\n* Styling:  Follow the existing app's color scheme and typography.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Navigate to specific setting screens for detailed editing (e.g., personal details), toggle settings (e.g., notifications), log out, delete account.\nSecondary Actions: Access information about account status (e.g. \"What is it?\" for Verified ID).\nScreen States: Default state (all settings displayed), loading state (while fetching data or saving changes), error states (if any), confirmation dialogs (before deleting account).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on toggle changes, confirmation messages on successful updates, clear error messaging.\n\n",
