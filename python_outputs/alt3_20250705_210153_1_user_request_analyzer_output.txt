Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain with product discovery and filtering within a marketplace app
User Type: Mobile users browsing and filtering products within a marketplace application.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and efficient search results page with easy-to-use filters due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  They may be browsing in various contexts and have limited attention spans.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View search results relevant to their query, filter results to refine search, locate desired products efficiently.
Secondary Goals: Sort results by various criteria (e.g., price, relevance, rating), view product details quickly, save search or filter preferences.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch interaction, potential for distractions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if:  Filters are clearly displayed and functional, product cards are easily tappable, loading indicators are present, and pagination is smooth and intuitive for navigating large result sets.

Content Requirements
Critical: List of search results (product cards with images, titles, and prices), filter chips (active and inactive states clearly indicated), pagination (if more than one page of results).
Supporting:  Sorting options (e.g., price: low to high, high to low, rating), refinement suggestions (based on active filters), total number of results found.
Contextual: Loading indicator while fetching results, empty state message if no results are found, error message for network issues.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical scrolling list of product cards, filter chips displayed above the product list, potentially sticky header containing search bar and filter count.
* Components: Product cards (image, title, price, rating), filter chips (representing filter categories and selected options), pagination controls (buttons or infinite scroll), search bar (may be inherited from a previous screen).
* Styling:  Consistent with the marketplace app's overall styling guide, clear visual hierarchy for filter chips and product cards (active filters highlighted).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Select a product card to view details, select/deselect filter chips to refine search results.
Secondary Actions: Sort results, adjust pagination (go to next/previous page), clear filters, access search settings.
Screen States: Loading state, results state (with products), empty state (no results), error state (network issue).
Feedback Needs: Visual indication of active filters, loading indicator during search, clear error messages, smooth pagination transitions.
