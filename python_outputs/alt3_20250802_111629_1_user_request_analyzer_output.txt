High-quality visuals are needed to impress, clear information to guide users, and a prominent call-to-action to drive conversions. While not a 'first impression' moment, the design should still be engaging and memorable within the context of e-commerce best practices.  Using enhanced design elements will make the screen attractive, functional and optimized for sales, but will not require a full expressive treatment."
