Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily scannable list,  with clear visual hierarchy due to screen size limitations.  Touch interactions are primary, and interruptions are common.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals:  Quickly assess notification importance, easily navigate to relevant content within the app based on the notification.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Five notification items are displayed correctly, with consistent layout and spacing;  user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are clearly visible for each; top bar and bottom navigation are present and functional;  visual hierarchy guides users' attention to important information.


Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications. User information (profile picture or initials, possibly name) in the top bar.
Supporting:  Number of unread notifications (badge or counter).
Contextual:  Indication of notification read/unread status (e.g., visual cue like bold text or checkmark).


Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** Vertical list of five notification items. Top bar at the top of the screen, bottom navigation at the bottom.
*   **Components:** Top bar (User Info), Notification Item (Avatar, Title, Description, Timestamp) x5, Bottom Navigation.
*   **Styling:**  Consistent styling across all notification items. Clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification).
Secondary Actions:  Navigation to other app screens via bottom navigation.
Screen States:  Default (showing 5 notifications), Empty state (no notifications), Loading state (fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual indication of loading progress and any errors.  Visual feedback to indicate read/unread status.
