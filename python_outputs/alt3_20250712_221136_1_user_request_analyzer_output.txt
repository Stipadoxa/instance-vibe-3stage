Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management
User Type: Mobile users managing their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily navigable settings screen with clear touch targets due to limited screen real estate and potential interruptions.  The screen must be easily usable with one hand.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify personal and business details, manage notification preferences, change account security settings, and log out.
Secondary Goals:  Easily find and update specific settings, understand the consequences of actions like deleting the account.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions, cognitive load from many options.
Ready for handoff if: All listed settings are accessible and clearly labeled, top and bottom app bars are present and functional, and sufficient spacing exists between interactive elements to ensure comfortable touch target sizes.


Content Requirements
Critical: Personal details (editable), business details (editable), "Change phone number," "Change email," "Change language," "Disable chats," "Disable Feedback," "Manage notifications," "Change password," "Delete my account permanently," "Log out."
Supporting:  Clear labels for each setting, helpful descriptions where needed (e.g., for notification management options).
Contextual:  Confirmation dialogs before irreversible actions (e.g., deleting the account), success/failure messages after changes.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical list of settings, divided into logical sections (e.g., Personal, Business, Account, Notifications) if appropriate. Top app bar and bottom app bar present.
* Components: Top app bar (with back button/navigation), list items with clear labels and potentially a right-pointing arrow indicator for settings with sub-menus (e.g., Manage Notifications), bottom app bar (with navigation or other relevant actions).
* Styling:  Consistent styling aligned with the overall app design.  Visual hierarchy to guide user attention to important settings.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Modify settings (all listed items).
Secondary Actions: Navigation via the top and bottom app bars.
Screen States:  Default state displaying all settings, loading state while saving changes, confirmation dialogs, success/error messages after actions.
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of changes saved, error messages if input is invalid (e.g., incorrect email format), loading indicators during data updates, confirmation before irreversible actions.
