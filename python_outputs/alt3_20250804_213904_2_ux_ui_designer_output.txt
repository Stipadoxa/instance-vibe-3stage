I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The dashboard homepage uses a vertical layout.  The top section features a `layoutContainer` with three stats cards arranged horizontally with `itemSpacing` of 16 for visual separation. Below this, a scrollable `native-vertical-scroll` container holds the recent activity feed, implemented using a `layoutContainer` with a vertical layout and sufficient `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom`. Action buttons are placed below the activity feed with appropriate spacing. The bottom navigation bar ("Bottom navigation") is positioned at the very bottom of the screen using another layout container. Horizontal sizing is used for full-width elements where appropriate (stats cards, and potentially elements within the activity feed if these components allow for horizontal fill).

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is designed to provide a quick overview of key seller metrics and facilitate easy access to essential actions. Stats cards offer immediate performance insights, while the activity feed provides context-relevant updates. The prominent placement of "Create New Listing" and "View All Messages" buttons allows for quick interaction with high-priority tasks. Bottom navigation provides consistent access to other sections of the seller dashboard.

4. **Component Choices:**  I chose "Bottom navigation" (ID: `10:4724`) for the bottom navigation because it directly matches the design system's provided component.  No alternatives were needed.

5. **Component Gaps:**  The design requires quick stats cards, and a recent activity feed.  Neither component fully corresponds to this.  For stats cards, I will use a `native-rectangle` with `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to achieve the full-width, card-like appearance, each containing a `native-text` element for the headline and value.  The recent activity feed requires a scrollable container as mentioned earlier; I chose to use a native vertical scroll to solve this gap, this provides a functional scrollable space for the activity feed items within constraints.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Prominence is established through visual size, position, and color contrast. Stats cards are larger and appear at the top. Action buttons have higher visual weight with a primary color, while navigation elements are consistently styled. Vertical spacing guides the eye through the content.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  The "Bottom navigation" component's `Device` variant will be selected as "Mobile" for the current specification, this depends on whether the seller dashboard is for a mobile app or website.

8. **Native Element Justification:** The need for stats cards and activity feed elements necessitated the use of native elements (`native-rectangle` and `native-text`).  These native elements are needed because no suitable components were found within the `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA` to fulfill the specific requirements of these UI elements efficiently.  Using native elements allows for efficient design and flexibility.
