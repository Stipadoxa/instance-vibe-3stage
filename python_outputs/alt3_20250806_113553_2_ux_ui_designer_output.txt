**SECTIONS:**

1. **header:** Contains user's avatar (`10:7773` with `variants`: {"Photo": "Yes"},  `24:10352`), name (`S:41bc7b6b83403f34c823d2b1e378bb17ce3eec9b`), username (`S:f2f398b32e6f9cebd50c9021906f7c9f265b60a7`), bio (`S:bd915a8e249e62bcbd25e1452467f0d46e3e59fc`), location (`S:bd915a8e249e62bcbd25e1452467f0d46e3e59fc`), and join date (`S:f2f398b32e6f9cebd50c9021906f7c9f265b60a7`).  This section provides essential user information at a glance.

2. **stats:** Displays follower count, following count, and post count using `native-text` elements styled with `S:dcab8b77791966d54e93e56c5bb7ae7fcf6d7262`. This section summarizes the user's profile statistics.

3. **activity:** Presents a list of recent activities (`10:10214` with `variants`: {"Condition": "2-line", "Leading": "None", "Trailing": "None", "Show overline": "False", "Show supporting text": "True"}, `S:963691efd88605f3543e1770d2ee930d56487d4a`, `S:37fbf72bca144feb88bafcb95f90abb6145649f0`). Each activity item includes type, text, timestamp, and a link (rendered as native-text). This section keeps users updated on recent actions.


**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Section Planning:** The section blueprint follows the "Profile" pattern: header, stats, activity. The header provides core user information. Stats offer a quick overview of profile engagement.  Activity displays recent actions, enhancing user engagement and providing context.

3. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical layout container (`layoutMode`: "VERTICAL") as the root, ensuring mobile-first responsiveness. The header section is positioned at the top, followed by stats and activity.  Level 1 containers use `"horizontalSizing": "FILL"` to span the full width of the screen.  Content padding (16px) is applied to these Level 1 containers, maintaining consistency with the "Mobile Sizing Mantra".  Internal component spacing is managed within the activity list items.

4. **User Flow Reasoning:** Users first see the user's avatar and basic information.  Stats provide context, and the activity feed promotes engagement by showing recent posts and interactions.  The user can then choose to follow or message the user through the actions section.

5. **Component Choices:** I chose `10:7773` (avatar / big) over `10:7798` (avatar / single) and `24:10352` (avatar / stack) because it provides the most visually appealing large avatar for the header.  `10:10214` (List item) was chosen for its ability to display multi-line text within the Activity section.

6. **Component Gaps:**  The design system lacks a specific component to display the stats (followers, following, posts).  I used three instances of `native-text` for the stats, styled appropriately for visual consistency. This provides a clean and informative presentation, maintaining readability while staying within system constraints.

7. **Visual Hierarchy:** The avatar is the most prominent element, followed by the user's name and username.  The bio is smaller and less prominent, supporting the primary information. The stats section uses a slightly smaller text size to maintain the hierarchy. Recent activity items are further down in the hierarchy for secondary emphasis.


8. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the avatar, I selected the "Yes" variant of the `Photo` property in the `10:7773` component to show the actual profile picture. For the `10:10214` (List Item),  "2-line" was selected for the condition variant because activity items often require multiple lines of text. "None" was chosen for leading and trailing to keep focus on the activity. "False" was selected for "Show overline" to avoid unnecessary separators. Finally, "True" was selected for "Show supporting text" to allow for the timestamp.

9. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements were needed beyond the ones implied by the usage of `native-text` within the `10:10214` component and the `native-text` elements for the stats, as these fulfilled requirements not explicitly supported by the design system components.
