  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates concise notification display.  Touch interaction is primary; design must accommodate finger-sized tap targets.  Users may be interrupted, requiring clear and concise information delivery.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications; understand the content of each notification (who it's from, what it's about, when it was sent).\nSecondary Goals:  Quickly assess the importance of each notification; potentially take action based on notification content (though actions themselves are not specified in this request and would require further elaboration).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space; reliance on touch input; potential for interruptions while viewing notifications.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction and are visually distinct from each other.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the five notifications), user info in the top bar.\nSupporting:  None specified in the request.\nContextual:  Potentially, indicators of unread notifications (though this is not specified).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Top bar (containing user info), Notification Item (containing user avatar, title, description, timestamp - repeated five times), Bottom Navigation.\n* Styling:  Not specified in the request.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification item).\nSecondary Actions: Navigate to other screens via bottom navigation.\nScreen States:  Default state (showing five notifications); potentially a \"no notifications\" state (not explicitly specified but should be considered).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications (if applicable).  Loading indicator if notifications are fetched asynchronously (if applicable).\n",
