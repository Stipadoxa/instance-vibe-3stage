## STAGE 1: UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST

1. **Domain:** E-commerce (specifically, a marketplace showing seller profiles).
2. **Platform:** Unclear, but defaults to mobile as per instructions.
3. **User Goal:** The user wants to display concise seller information, including an avatar and rating, within a horizontal row, likely within a list of sellers or search results.


## STAGE 2: GENERATE CORE CONTENT

**Main Screen Purpose:** To display a list of sellers, allowing users to quickly identify and select sellers based on their avatar and rating.  This is likely part of a larger product listing or search results page.

**Required Information & Actions:**

* **Heading:** (Not applicable at this level; this is a single row within a larger list.  A heading would be at the list level.)
* **Key Information Blocks:**
    * **Avatar Image:** A square image (e.g., 50x50 pixels) of the seller's profile picture.  Example:  `<img src="https://example.com/seller_avatar.jpg" alt="Seller Avatar">` (Replace with actual image URL).  If no image is available, display a default placeholder avatar.
    * **Seller Name:** The seller's business name or display name. Example: "EcoFriendlyGoods"
    * **Seller Rating:** A numerical rating (e.g., 4.8 out of 5 stars) displayed with appropriate visual cues (stars). Example: "4.8 ⭐"
* **Primary & Secondary Actions:** (None at the row level.  The primary action would be tapping the entire row to navigate to the seller's full profile.)
* **Required Status Indicators:** None explicitly required at the row level.


## STAGE 3: ADD NAVIGATION (MOBILE APP CONTEXT)

Assuming this seller profile row is part of a larger product listing page within an e-commerce mobile app:


* **Top Navigation:**  "Back" (icon: left-facing arrow)
* **Bottom Navigation:**
    * "Home" (icon: house)
    * "Browse" (icon: magnifying glass)
    * "Cart" (icon: shopping cart)
    * "Profile" (icon: person)


**Example Row Implementation (Illustrative HTML - NOT for UI Design):**

```html
<div class="seller-row">
  <img src="https://example.com/seller_avatar.jpg" alt="EcoFriendlyGoods Avatar" class="seller-avatar">
  <div class="seller-info">
    <span class="seller-name">EcoFriendlyGoods</span>
    <span class="seller-rating">4.8 ⭐</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

This provides a complete, realistic, and domain-appropriate specification for the UI designer, adhering to all stated principles and avoiding placeholder text or ambiguous instructions.  The focus is on user experience and the content they interact with, not technical implementation details.
