Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily scannable notification list due to screen size limitations.  Touch interaction is primary; the design needs to account for fingertip tap targets.  Notifications may be viewed in various contexts (e.g., interruptions, focused attention).

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals: Quickly assess notification importance, navigate to relevant content from the notification.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices; users may be briefly interacting, needing quick understanding; potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if: Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is implemented; all UI elements meet minimum tap target sizes for mobile.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the five notifications), user information in the top bar.
Supporting:  Notification read/unread status indicator.
Contextual:  Potentially, a "Mark all as read" option if multiple unread notifications exist.

Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** Vertical list for notifications, top bar for user info, bottom navigation bar.
*   **Components:** Notification item (repeating component) showing user avatar, title, description, timestamp.  Top bar showing user name/profile picture (or relevant identification). Bottom navigation bar with appropriate navigation items.
*   **Styling:**  Appropriate styling to ensure readability and visual hierarchy (e.g., larger font size for titles, clear visual separation between items).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (tapping a notification item).
Secondary Actions: Mark all as read (if implemented).
Screen States:  Default state (showing 5 notifications), Empty state (no notifications), Loading state (fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual cues for read/unread notifications (e.g., bold font for unread).  Loading indicator while fetching notifications.
