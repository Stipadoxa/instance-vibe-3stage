## üì§ OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### SECTION 1: DESIGN RATIONALE

# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied

- **Typography Hierarchy**: The design leverages the provided design system's typography hierarchy to ensure clear visual communication.  `Title/Medium` is used for the seller name, providing prominence within the row, while `Body/Medium` is used for the seller rating, establishing it as secondary information. This follows the design system's classification of `primary` (most important), `secondary` (supporting), and `tertiary` (least important) text styles.

- **Spacing System**:  The horizontal arrangement of elements uses `itemSpacing: 8` within the row container to create a visually cohesive unit. This close spacing reflects the close relationship between the avatar, seller name, and rating. The parent container (presumably a list) would utilize a larger `itemSpacing` value (e.g., 12 or 16) to provide visual separation between seller rows.

- **Component Behavior**:  Since no suitable component exists in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA` for the specific requirements of a seller profile row, a `layoutContainer` with native elements (`native-image` for the avatar, `native-text` for the seller name and rating) is used.  The `native-image` accounts for a potential missing image URL by using a default placeholder avatar from the design system (if available), demonstrating a fallback strategy. The `horizontalSizing` and `layoutAlign` are set to "HUG" for elements like the avatar to prevent excessive stretching.


- **Color Application**:  The background color of the row is set to `White/white100` for optimal readability and contrast with the text. The seller name uses `Neutral/neutral90` for text color, ensuring sufficient contrast.  The star rating could utilize `Primary/primary50` for a brand accent or `Neutral/neutral50` for a more neutral appearance.  This adheres to the principle of using exact color names from the design system.


- **Layout Strategy**: A `layoutContainer` with `layoutMode: HORIZONTAL` is used to arrange the seller avatar, name, and rating in a horizontal row. This supports the user goal of quick identification and selection. The `primaryAxisSizingMode` is set to "AUTO" to allow the row to adjust its height based on the content, ensuring optimal responsiveness.


## Domain Context Integration

- **Industry Patterns**: The design mirrors standard e-commerce marketplace practices by prominently displaying a seller's avatar, name, and rating. This allows users to quickly assess seller credibility and choose reputable sellers.

- **User Mental Models**: The horizontal layout follows the user's likely mental model of browsing seller profiles in a list-like format. Placing the avatar, name, and rating in a horizontal row mirrors common online directory and marketplace designs that users are familiar with.

- **Contextual Adaptations**:  The design is adaptable to varying seller profile information.  If additional information becomes necessary (e.g., a short description), the `layoutContainer` can easily accommodate extra `native-text` elements using the defined spacing and typography rules.


## Design System Compliance

- **Component Verification**: All componentNodeIds used in the design (if any) were confirmed to exist within the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.  In this case, a layoutContainer was used due to the lack of a direct component match.

- **Variant Completeness**:  N/A (as native elements were used).  If components were used, all relevant variants would be fully specified.

- **Text Property Mapping**:  N/A (as native elements were used). If components were selected, the text properties would match the design system's textLayer names precisely.

- **Schema Adherence**: The `layoutContainer` structure and properties adhere strictly to the design system's layout container specifications.
