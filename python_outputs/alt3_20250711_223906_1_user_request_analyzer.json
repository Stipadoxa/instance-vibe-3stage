  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain focusing on product display and purchase initiation\nUser Type: Mobile shoppers browsing product listings\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need concise product information, clear calls to action, and large, easily tappable elements due to smaller screen size and touch interaction.  Visual appeal is crucial to capture attention in a potentially distracting environment.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially see a rating or short description if space allows.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, need for quick loading times.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Product image, product title, product price, \"Buy\" button\nSupporting:  Short product description (if space permits), rating (if available and space permits).\nContextual:  \"Out of Stock\" message if applicable, sale badge if applicable.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single card layout, likely vertical orientation to maximize use of vertical space.\n* Components: Image (prominent), Title (clear and concise), Price (easily readable), Buy button (clearly labeled and visually distinct).\n* Styling:  Consider using consistent styling with the overall app design.  High-quality image is essential.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Tap \"Buy\" button\nSecondary Actions:  Potentially tap image to enlarge or view more details (if navigating to a separate product details page).\nScreen States: Default (product displayed), \"Adding to Cart\" (brief loading indicator), \"Added to Cart\" (confirmation message).\nFeedback Needs:  Visual confirmation of successful addition to cart, clear error messages if applicable (e.g., out of stock).\n\nReady for handoff if:  All critical content is displayed clearly, the \"Buy\" button is prominent and easily tappable, and the design is consistent with the overall mobile app's style guide.\n",
