They may be using the app in various contexts and may be interrupted easily.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage app preferences.\nSecondary Goals:  Easily understand each setting's purpose and effect. Access help or information where needed.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are included, using existing app components, navigation is clear and consistent with app standards, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Personal details (section with ability to edit), Business details (section with ability to edit), Access to Cars45 auction (toggle switch), \"Verified ID\" badge (with explanation), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats (toggle switch), Disable Feedback (toggle switch), Manage notifications (link to another screen), Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  Clear labels and descriptions for each setting.\nContextual:  Error messages for invalid input, loading indicators where applicable, confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (e.g., delete account).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single column list of settings, similar to reference image, with top and bottom app navigation bars.\n* Components:  Use existing app components for list items, toggle switches, and buttons.  Each setting should be presented as a distinct list item.\n* Styling: Maintain existing app's color scheme and typography.

(Tap on \"Manage Notifications\" to navigate to a new screen) Tap on \"Log out\" to log out.
