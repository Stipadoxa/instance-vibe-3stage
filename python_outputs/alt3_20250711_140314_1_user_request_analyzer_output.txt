Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication and User Preferences domain within a mobile application
User Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings, view and adjust notification preferences, and securely log out.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise settings page with clear, easily tappable controls due to screen size limitations and touch-based interaction.  The design must account for potential interruptions and varying network conditions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals:  View and update user profile information, manage notification settings, securely log out of the application.
Secondary Goals: Access help or support related to settings, easily find and understand all available settings options.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during use, varying levels of digital literacy among users.
Ready for handoff if:  All primary actions (profile edit, notification toggle, logout) are clearly visible and easily accessible via touch targets that meet minimum size guidelines;  a clear visual hierarchy guides the user through the settings options;  all content is legible and understandable.

Content Requirements
Critical: User profile information (at minimum, display name or username), notification toggle (with clear on/off indication), logout button.
Supporting:  Edit profile button (linking to a dedicated profile editing screen),  help or support link, version number, privacy policy link (depending on app context).
Contextual:  Success/failure messages after profile updates or logout, loading indicators during asynchronous operations.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Edit Profile, Toggle Notifications, Logout.
Secondary Actions: Access Help/Support
Screen States: Default (showing current settings), Loading (during profile update/logout), Success/Error (after actions).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of notification status (on/off), confirmation messages after actions (successful profile update or logout), loading indicators for long-running operations.

Structural & Component Directives

* Layout:  Likely a single-column layout or a vertically scrolling layout to accommodate the limited screen real estate. Sections should be clearly separated.
* Components: Header (potentially with app logo or title), User Profile Section (with display name, profile picture if applicable, and Edit Profile button), Notification Toggle (a switch or similar control), Logout Button (prominently positioned).
* Styling:  Consistent with overall app styling guidelines.  Ensure sufficient spacing between components for easy touch interaction.
