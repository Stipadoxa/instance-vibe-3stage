Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with performance monitoring and data visualization
User Type: Business users reviewing key performance indicators (KPIs) on a mobile device.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise overview, prioritizing key metrics.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient use of space and potentially scrolling.  Touch interaction needs to be considered for all elements.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Quickly view key performance indicators (users, revenue, growth).
Secondary Goals: Understand trends in user, revenue, and growth data over time. Potentially drill down into the detailed data behind each metric.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile, potential for network limitations affecting data loading.  Distractions and interruptions common on mobile.
Ready for handoff if: All three metric cards (users, revenue, growth) are clearly displayed, the chart placeholder is evident, and the header is present.  Touch targets are appropriately sized.

Content Requirements
Critical: "Analytics Dashboard" header, three metric cards (Users, Revenue, Growth) displaying numerical values and appropriate units, chart placeholder indicating data visualization area.
Supporting: Units of measurement for each metric (e.g., users, $, percentage).  Loading indicators for data.
Contextual: Error messages if data fails to load, potentially data refresh option.

Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** Single-screen dashboard layout with header, three metric cards above a chart section.  Vertical layout.
*   **Components:** Header with title "Analytics Dashboard", three metric cards (each with a title, numerical value, and units), chart section (placeholder for a chart).
*   **Styling:**  (Styling specifics not provided in request - to be determined based on broader design system)


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  View detailed data (potentially implied by tapping on metric cards or chart).
Secondary Actions: Refresh data (potential).
Screen States: Default state (data loaded), loading state (data fetching), error state (data load failure).
Feedback Needs: Loading indicator while fetching data, clear error messages if data fails to load.
