**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure.  The top section contains a search bar and filter button, both full width. The product grid below uses a horizontal layout with wrapping enabled to accommodate various screen sizes.  Each product card has consistent spacing and padding (8px) for readability. `horizontalSizing` is used where applicable to ensure proper layout behaviour.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user begins by entering search terms in the search bar, which initiates a search and displays relevant results in the grid below.  The filter button allows users to refine the search results based on further criteria. Clicking a product card navigates to its details page (not included in this specification).

4. **Component Choices:** 
    - **Search Bar:** I chose `10:12086` (search-field) because it directly provides the necessary search functionality and integrates well with the design system. I considered using a `native-text` element for the input field but chose the dedicated component for consistent UI behaviour and built-in functionality.
    - **Filter Button:** I chose `10:3907` (Button) with `variants`: { "Type": "Filled", "Size": "Medium", "State": "Default" } for a clear visual cue.  `635:4347` (icon/filter) was used to clearly signal the filter action. Alternatives like `10:8132` (filter-chip) were less suitable as they are better suited for a selection-style filter.
    - **Product Card:** I chose `147:3743` (product card) component as it provided a ready-made container for product details. While a custom grid of native elements would have worked for the layout, this component provides the optimal balance between styling and layout capabilities.  Its `variants` are configured for a 'grid' view.

5. **Component Gaps:**  The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying seller ratings (star ratings).  I addressed this gap using a combination of the `635:4752` (icon/star) component, instantiated multiple times to reflect the rating, and a `native-text` component to show the number of reviews (e.g., "(47)").

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  The search bar and filter button are prominently displayed at the top. The product cards form a clear visual grid, emphasizing the primary content.  Consistent typography (using design system text styles where available) guides the user through the information architecture.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  For the search bar, the `State: "default"` variant was chosen to reflect the initial state.  The Filter button uses `"Type": "Filled", "Size": "Medium", "State": "Default"` variants to provide a clear call to action. The product card leverages the `"view": "grid"` and `"type": "normal"` variants for this specific layout context.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  A `native-text` component was used to display the number of reviews in each product card. This was necessary because there was no specific design system component for showing review counts adjacent to the star rating icons.
