  "content": "Domain & Context\n\nDomain: E-commerce domain specifically for food delivery services.\nUser Type: Mobile users seeking to order food, groceries, or other goods for delivery.  Users may be at home, work, or elsewhere, potentially facing distractions and limited attention spans.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a visually appealing, intuitive homepage with large touch targets and quick access to key functionalities.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring prioritization of content and efficient use of space.\n\nUser Requirements\n\nPrimary Goals: Quickly browse available food and delivery options, initiate a search for specific items or restaurants, and begin the ordering process.\nSecondary Goals: Discover new restaurants or services, utilize loyalty points, check current location services,  and understand available delivery categories.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential distractions, varying network conditions, and competing notifications.\n\nReady for handoff if:  Primary action (initiate search or select a category) is clearly prominent,  all elements (header, hero, category cards, services) are appropriately sized for touch interaction,  and visual hierarchy guides usersâ€™ attention efficiently. Category cards and service cards have clear visual distinctions.\n\nContent Requirements\n\nCritical:  Current location (with option to change), search bar, category cards (restaurants, grocery, etc.),  \"See all\" links for each category, hero banner image showcasing popular items,  points balance display.\nSupporting:  \"24/7\" and \"New\" badges on relevant category cards or service cards,  a visually appealing and easily understood presentation of provider cards in the services section.\nContextual:  Personalized recommendations (based on past orders or location),  notifications of new promotions or offers,  error messages regarding location services or network connectivity.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\n\nPrimary Actions: Initiate a search, select a category card to browse options, tap a service provider card to view details.\nSecondary Actions: Change location, view points details, access the bottom navigation tabs (Account, Orders, etc. - these are implied by the specification).\nScreen States: Default state (initial load), loading state (while fetching data), error state (location not found, network error), search results state.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback (e.g., loading indicator) during data retrieval,  error messages providing helpful instructions for resolving issues, and real-time updates to the search results as text input changes.\n",
