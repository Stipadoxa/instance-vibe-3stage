  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management and settings configuration.  Specific context is a mobile application likely related to auctions or similar business transactions (Cars45 reference suggests this).\nUser Type: Mobile app users who need to manage their account settings, preferences, and personal information.  This includes users managing their business profiles if applicable.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive settings page due to screen size limitations. Touch interactions must be considered, and design should account for potential interruptions.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal information, manage account preferences (e.g., notifications, language), review account status (e.g., verified ID), and manage business details (if applicable).\nSecondary Goals:  Easily understand the purpose and implications of each setting, securely manage sensitive information (e.g., password), receive clear feedback on changes made.\nUser Constraints: Small screen real estate necessitates prioritization and concise information design. Touch interactions must be precise and easy to use. Users may be interrupted during interaction.\nReady for handoff if:  All settings listed in the reference image are present and functional, using components from the provided design system.  Navigation is intuitive and clear.  Touch targets meet minimum size requirements.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Personal details (edit option), Business details (edit option), Access to Cars45 auction (status indicator), \"Verified ID\" badge (status and explanation link), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats, Disable feedback, Manage notifications, Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  Clear visual indicators of active/inactive states, help text (\"What is it?\") for unclear settings.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid input, loading indicators for actions requiring server communication, confirmation messages after changes.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single-column list view, similar to the reference image, utilizing the provided design system components (list items, buttons, etc.).\n* Components:  Use pre-existing list item components from the provided design system.  Buttons for actions (e.g., \"Change phone number\").  Switch components for toggles (e.g., \"Disable chats\").  A status indicator component for settings with states (e.g., \"Access to Cars45 auction\").\n* Styling: Adhere to the color scheme and visual hierarchy demonstrated in the reference image, aligning with the design system's established patterns.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Navigating to a specific setting, modifying a setting value (e.g., changing email address), activating/deactivating a setting (e.g., disabling chats), confirming account deletion.\nSecondary Actions: Accessing help or explanatory information (\"What is it?\").\nScreen States:  Default state, loading states (if applicable), error states, success/confirmation states.\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indicators of successful changes, error messages for incorrect input, loading indicators for asynchronous actions.\n",
