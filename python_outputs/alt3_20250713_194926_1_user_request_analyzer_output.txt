Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management
User Type: Mobile app users managing their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive interface with clear navigation and touch-friendly controls.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of settings.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage notifications, and securely log out.
Secondary Goals:  View account status information (e.g., "Verified ID" badge), access help resources ("What is it?"), easily change key account details.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, need for clear visual hierarchy to quickly locate desired settings.
Ready for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are implemented using the provided design system components, navigation is intuitive, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.  Important settings are easily accessible.

Content Requirements
Critical:  Personal details section, business details section, notification management settings, change password, log out.
Supporting: Change phone number, change email, change language, disable chats, disable feedback, "Verified ID" badge status and explanation.
Contextual:  Status indicators (e.g., "Active" for Cars45 auction access), help text ("What is it?").

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Single column list of settings, similar to the reference image, using the provided design system components for list items.  Header includes back navigation and "Settings" title.  Each setting should use a consistent design component with clear visual hierarchy.  Consider using dividers to visually separate sections.
* Components:  Use standard list items from the provided design system. Each list item should include a clear setting label and, where appropriate, supplementary information (status indicators, help text, navigation indicators).
* Styling:  Refer to the provided design system and reference image for color palette, typography, and overall visual style.  Maintain consistency with the existing app's design language.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Navigate to specific setting pages, save changes, log out.
Secondary Actions: Access help information ("What is it?").
Screen States: Default state (all settings displayed), potentially loading state if settings are dynamically fetched, success states after saving changes, and error states for input validation or network issues.
Feedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on changes saved, loading indicators during data retrieval or saving, error messages for invalid input or failure to save changes.
