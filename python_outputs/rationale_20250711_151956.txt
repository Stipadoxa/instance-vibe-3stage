üìù Original User Request:
create product card with image, title, price, and buy button

üìã Analyzed Requirements:
User Requirements
Primary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase.
Secondary Goals:  Compare similar products (implicitly), easily add to cart/wishlist (depending on design choices for the "buy button").
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for slow network connections impacting image loading.
Ready for handoff if: Image loads reliably, title, price, and "buy" button are clearly visible and have appropriately sized touch targets; text is legible at typical mobile viewing distances.

üé® Designer Rationale:
{
  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout is a single-column vertical structure, optimized for mobile screens. This maximizes space efficiency and readability, ensuring all critical product information is easily accessible.  Vertical alignment prioritizes the product image above the title and price, creating a natural visual flow. Consistent spacing (24px) between elements maintains visual harmony and improves readability.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user flow is designed to be straightforward: users first see a prominent product image, followed by the title and price. The 'Buy' button provides a clear call to action, enabling a quick purchase. A concise visual hierarchy guides the user's attention and ensures efficient information processing.",
    "componentChoices": "The 'IMAGES' component is used for the product image to handle potential loading states and display errors appropriately. The 'text' component is used for the title and price, with styling provided using textStyle and colorStyleName for clear hierarchy and visual separation. A 'Button' component facilitates the purchase action. The choice of components aligns with the design system, ensuring consistency and maintainability.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Visual hierarchy is established through the size and placement of elements. The product image is the most prominent element, followed by the title and price, which are larger than the supporting text. High-contrast colors for the price and the 'Buy' button (using color styles) further enhance visual distinction and readability.  The order of elements visually reinforces the prioritization of primary actions."
  }
}

üîß Engineer Rationale:
{
  "implementationRationale": {
    "componentSelection": "The component IDs (10:7816 and 10:3907) are directly used from the input for the image and button components, respectively.  The 'text' component is a generic Figma text element, assumed to be sufficient for the title and price.",
    "styleApplication": "Text styles ('Title/Medium', 'Title/Large') and color styles ('Neutral/neutral90', 'Primary/primary90') are directly applied as provided in the input, maintaining consistency with the design system.",
    "designSystemMapping": "The input directly specifies the components and styles from the design system.  No mapping or translation was necessary; the design system elements are used as-is.",
    "variantDecisions": "Button variants ('Size: Large', 'Type: Filled', 'State: Default', 'Color: Green') are directly used from the input to configure the button component."
  }
