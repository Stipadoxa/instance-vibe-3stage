This follows established best practices for landing page design.\",\n    \"userFlowReasoning\": \"The user flow is linear, guiding the user through the key information and ending with a clear call to action to sign up for a free trial.  This ensures a smooth and efficient user journey.\",\n    \"componentChoices\": \"I chose the Button component (id: 10:3907) for the call to action because it provides a clear, easily recognizable interaction pattern. I considered using a native button, but this would have risked inconsistencies in appearance and behavior with the rest of the application's UI and therefore I opted to leverage the design system for a more coherent experience.  I also considered using a Text component with an onClick event, but the Button's built-in styling and clear visual affordances are better suited for a high-impact CTA. The design system's button component also provides better accessibility features. \",\n    \"visualHierarchy\": \"Visual hierarchy is established through a combination of size, color, and positioning. The hero section headline is the largest and most prominent element, followed by the subheadline and feature descriptions. This guided the user's attention naturally to the core selling points and the CTA button. \",\n    \"variantSelectionRationale\": \"For the CTA button, I chose the \\\"Size: Large\\\", \\\"Type: Filled\\\", \\\"Color: Green\\\", and \\\"State: Default\\\" variants.  The large size makes it highly visible, the filled type is prominent, the green color signals a positive action, and the default state ensures a consistent appearance. I considered using a smaller size and outlined or text button for better contrast, but the overall impact and usability of a large button makes it suitable for a high-impact CTA. I did not use any disabled or hover state as I believed that these states could distract from the primary conversion goal. \",\n    \"nativeElementJustification\": \"With moment significance of 0.9 and first_touch journey position, this landing page warrants expressive treatment.  Native gradient backgrounds and decorative shapes create memorable first impressions and a visually stunning atmosphere while component-based interactions ensure reliability and systematic consistency with the design system. The expressive treatment is consistent with the suggestedTreatment in designContext.\"\n  }\n}\n---RATIONALE-SEPARATOR---\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"E-commerce Landing Page\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 0,\n    \"paddingTop\": 0,\n    \"paddingBottom\": 0,\n    \"paddingLeft\": 0,\n    \"paddingRight\": 0,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"native-rectangle\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"width\": 600,\n          \"height\": 400,\n          \"fill\": {\n            \"type\": \"GRADIENT_LINEAR\",\n            \"stops\": [\n              {\n                \"color\": {\n                  \"r\": 0.0,\n                  \"g\": 0.7,\n                  \"b\": 0.3,\n                  \"a\": 1\n                },\n                \"position\": 0\n              },\n              {\n                \"color\": {\n                  \"r\": 0.0,\n                  \"g\": 0.5,\n                  \"b\": 0.8,\n                  \"a\": 1\n                },\n                \"position\": 1\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          \"cornerRadius\": 12,\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"native-text\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"content\": \"Headline: Your AI-Powered SaaS Product\",\n          \"fontSize\": 32,\n          \"fontWeight\": \"bold\",\n          \"alignment\": \"center\",\n          \"color\": \"primary-50\",\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"native-text\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"content\": \"Subheadline:  Effortless Automation, Intelligent Insights\",\n          \"fontSize\": 16,\n          \"fontWeight\": \"normal\",\n          \"alignment\": \"center\",\n          \"color\": \"neutral-50\",\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n        \"name\": \"Button\",\n        \"suggestedType\": \"button\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n          \"Size\": \"Large\",\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"Default\",\n          \"Color\": \"Green\"\n        },\n        \"Action\": \"Start Free Trial\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"native-circle\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"width\": 100,\n          \"height\": 100,\n          \"fill\": {\n            \"r\": 0.2,\n            \"g\": 0.6,\n            \"b\": 0.9\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
