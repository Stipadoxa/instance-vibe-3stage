Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain with a focus on user notifications.
User Type: Mobile users who need to access and manage their notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily scannable list, prioritizing important information due to screen size limitations.  Touch interaction and potential interruptions need to be considered.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals: Potentially mark notifications as read, access the context of each notification by tapping on it.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile, users may only glance at the list briefly, touch-based interaction.
Ready for handoff if:  Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp. Top bar with user info and bottom navigation are present and functional. All UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar.
Supporting:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., badge or visual cue).
Contextual:  Potentially a "Mark as Read" option (per notification or bulk).

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list of 5 notification items.  Top bar for user information. Bottom navigation bar.
* Components: Notification Item (repeating component): User Avatar (circular image), Title (text, bold), Description (text), Timestamp (text, smaller font). Top Bar: User Avatar, User Name. Bottom Navigation:  (Number of tabs not specified, further information required).
* Styling:  (Specific styling details are not provided, further information is needed).


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification).
Secondary Actions:  Mark as read (if implemented).
Screen States: Default (showing 5 notifications), potentially empty state (no notifications).  Loading state (if fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual indication of unread notifications.  Feedback on successful "Mark as Read" action (if implemented).
