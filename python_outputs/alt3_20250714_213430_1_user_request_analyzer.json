  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Settings management within a mobile application context (Cars45 auction platform implied).\nUser Type: Mobile users of the Cars45 auction app needing to manage account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users expect a simple, intuitive interface with clear navigation and touch-friendly elements. Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient information presentation.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal information, manage account preferences (notifications, communication settings), and securely log out.\nSecondary Goals: Understand account status (e.g., \"Verified ID\" badge), access help/information (e.g., \"What is it?\").\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All settings options from the reference image are included, navigation is consistent with the app's design system, and touch targets meet accessibility standards.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (name, contact info), business details (if applicable), account settings (notifications, language, chats, feedback), password change, account deletion, logout.  Access to Cars45 auction status. \"Verified ID\" badge with explanation.\nSupporting:  Information links (\"What is it?\" for relevant settings).\nContextual:  Status indicators (e.g., \"Active\" for auction access).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  List-based layout, similar to the reference image, with top and bottom app navigation.  Each setting item should be a row with a label and appropriate action (toggle, detail screen navigation).\n* Components:  Use existing app components for list items, toggles, and navigation.  The navigation should consist of a top navigation bar for back button and title and a bottom navigation bar as per app standard.\n* Styling: Adhere to the existing app's color palette and styling guidelines.  Maintain visual consistency with other app screens.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Navigate to a detail screen to modify settings, toggle settings on/off, initiate logout.\nSecondary Actions: Access help/information links.\nScreen States:  Default state, potentially loading state while fetching settings data.\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback for toggled settings (on/off states clearly indicated).  Loading indicators where applicable.\n",
