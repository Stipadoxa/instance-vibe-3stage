SECTIONS:
1. gallery: Displays multiple product photos to showcase the used laptop visually. This is crucial for e-commerce, allowing potential buyers to assess the laptop's condition and aesthetics.
2. essentials: Presents the core details of the laptop listing, including title, price, and key specifications.  This section provides essential information for buyers to quickly understand the product.
3. purchase: Contains a primary call-to-action button ("Contact Seller") enabling direct interaction with the seller to discuss the purchase. This facilitates the transaction process.

DESIGN RATIONALE:
1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.
2. **Section Planning:** The section blueprint follows the e-commerce pattern: gallery→essentials→purchase→seller.  The "reviews" and "related" sections are omitted for the MVP mobile-first design to maintain simplicity and focus on core functionality. The user request emphasizes photos, essential details, and seller contact, hence the prioritization.
3. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical layout container for the root, with the gallery section filling the top of the screen, followed by the essentials and purchase sections in a vertically stacked manner. Level 1 containers use `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to span the full width of the screen.  Internal padding (16px) is applied to the essentials and purchase containers to ensure appropriate spacing between the content and the screen edges.  The image gallery is handled using a horizontal wrap layout container to allow for responsive display of multiple images.
4. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is designed to be linear and intuitive.  The user first sees the product images, then the essential details, and finally, they can contact the seller to initiate a purchase.  This flow prioritizes visual appeal and quick access to essential information.
5. **Component Choices:** 
    - For the images in the gallery section, I chose `10:7816` (IMAGES) with variant `Type: "2+ images"` because it provides a flexible layout for multiple images, and it is designed for display and is the best fit for the given design system. I considered using a series of `native-rectangle` elements with image fills, but this approach would require more manual adjustments to achieve a seamless layout, and `10:7816` manages it effectively.
    - For the main title "Dell XPS 13 9310 - Used", I used `native-text` with textStyle "Title/Large" because it provides the optimal heading size and is consistent with the design system's typography.  Alternatives considered were "Headline/Medium" and "Headline/Small", however "Title/Large" best communicates the main product name.
    - For the price `$899.00`, I used `native-text` with `textStyle` "Title/Medium" for clear visibility, compared to `Body/Large` which is less prominent. 
    - For the "Contact Seller" button, I chose `10:3907` (Button) with variants `Platform: "Android+Web"`, `Size: "Medium"`, `Type: "Filled"`, `State: "Default"`, `Color: "Green"`  because it offers a clear and visually appealing CTA which is consistent with the design system's button styles. Alternatives were not considered as this is a standard CTA button.

6. **Component Gaps:** The user request includes a seller profile section with a rating and reviews. The design system does not have a dedicated "seller profile" component. Therefore, I implemented this using a combination of `10:7773` (avatar / big) for the profile picture, and `native-text` elements to display the seller's name, membership date, rating, and number of reviews.  This workaround maintains a clean layout and conveys all the necessary information within the constraints of the system.
7. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the use of `native-text` with varying textStyles and sizes, starting from "Title/Large" for the product title, progressively decreasing the size and prominence for the price and secondary details. The image gallery is placed prominently at the top to draw the user's attention to the product itself, followed by the essential details and then the contact CTA.
8. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:7816` (IMAGES) component, I selected the `Type: "2+ images"` variant to accommodate the three provided product images. The alternative, `Type: "1 image"`, wouldn't suffice.  The button `10:3907` uses "Medium" size to create balanced space and readability.
9. **Native Element Justification:**  Native `native-text` elements were used to create the seller profile information (name, membership details, rating, and reviews) because the design system lacks a component specifically designed for this purpose. Native `native-text` provides a flexible solution to display the required information while maintaining a consistent visual style.
