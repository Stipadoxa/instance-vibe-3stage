## Information Architecture Specification:  My Awesome Mobile App

This specification outlines the information architecture for "My Awesome Mobile App," focusing on content structure and functional requirements, independent of any specific design system.  The goal is to provide a flexible framework adaptable to Material Design, iOS Human Interface Guidelines, or custom design systems.

**Screen Architecture**

**Layout Structure:**
Screen Pattern: Hub-and-Spoke (central hub screen with links to other features)
Navigation Flow: Tab-based sections (bottom navigation bar)
Content Organization: Fixed header + scrollable content

**Mobile Framework:**
Primary Interactions: Touch-based, tap interactions, swipe gestures for navigation where appropriate.  Thumb zone priority for primary actions in the bottom third of the screen.
Content Prioritization:  Critical information (e.g., account balance, urgent notifications) at the top of the screen.  Less critical information revealed through scrolling.
Action Accessibility: Primary actions are placed within the thumb zone.  Secondary actions are accessible but not prioritized.


**Content Requirements**

**1. Account Overview (Priority: Critical)**

**Content Structure:**
Primary Content: Account balance, user name, profile picture
Secondary Content: Recent transactions summary, available credit
Metadata: Last updated timestamp
Interactive Elements: Tap profile picture to edit profile, tap transaction summary to view details

**Functional Requirements:**
Display Capability: Fixed header, scrollable content, status indication (e.g., low balance warning)
Interaction Patterns: Tap to navigate, swipe to refresh
Content Adaptation: Multi-line for details, single-line for balance.

**Implementation Options:**
Primary Approach: Card with header (profile picture and name), body (balance, summary), and trailing metadata (timestamp).
Alternative Approaches:  List with separate sections for balance, summary, and metadata.
Content Mapping: Title  "header text", Balance  "primary text", Summary  "supporting text", Timestamp  "metadata text"
Mobile Considerations: Large, clear display of balance; sufficient touch target for profile picture.

**Semantic Keywords:** account, balance, profile, transaction, status

**Component Fallback Strategy:**
Design System Priority: High
Fallback Guidance: If a card component isn't available, use a combination of native text views and image views to achieve a similar layout.


**2. Transactions (Priority: High)**

**Content Structure:**
Primary Content: Transaction date, description, amount
Secondary Content: Transaction type (debit/credit), merchant (if applicable)
Metadata: None
Interactive Elements: Tap a transaction to view details

**Functional Requirements:**
Display Capability: Scrollable list, filtering options (date range, type)
Interaction Patterns: Tap to navigate, pull-to-refresh
Content Adaptation: Multi-line for description, single-line for date, amount, type.

**Implementation Options:**
Primary Approach: List item with leading element (date), primary text (description), and trailing text (amount).
Alternative Approaches: Card list, table view.
Content Mapping: Date  "leading text", Description  "primary text", Amount  "trailing text"
Mobile Considerations:  Clear visual separation between transactions; efficient scrolling behavior.

**Semantic Keywords:** transaction, list, item, date, amount, filter

**Component Fallback Strategy:**
Design System Priority: Medium
Fallback Guidance:  If a standard list item isn't available, a native table view can be used.


**3. Settings (Priority: Medium)**

**Content Structure:**
Primary Content: Setting name (e.g., Notifications, Security)
Secondary Content: Brief description of each setting
Metadata: On/Off switch or other status indicator (where applicable)
Interactive Elements: Tap a setting to configure it

**Functional Requirements:**
Display Capability: Scrollable list, on/off switches, segmented controls (if needed)
Interaction Patterns: Tap to navigate, toggle switches
Content Adaptation: Multi-line for descriptions, single-line for setting names.

**Implementation Options:**
Primary Approach: List item with leading text (setting name), trailing text (brief description), and trailing switch/indicator.
Alternative Approaches:  Simple card list, segmented controls for certain settings.
Content Mapping:  Name  "primary text", Description  "secondary text", Status  "trailing switch"
Mobile Considerations:  Clearly labeled settings; sufficient space for toggles and descriptions.

**Semantic Keywords:** settings, list, item, switch, toggle, configuration


**Component Fallback Strategy:**
Design System Priority: Medium
Fallback Guidance: If design system switches are unavailable, native switch controls may be used.


**4. Notifications (Priority: High)**

**Content Structure:**
Primary Content: Notification message
Secondary Content: Timestamp, sender (if applicable)
Metadata: Read/Unread status
Interactive Elements: Tap notification to view details, swipe to dismiss

**Functional Requirements:**
Display Capability: Scrollable list, status indication (read/unread), swipe actions.
Interaction Patterns: Tap to navigate, swipe to dismiss
Content Adaptation: Multi-line for message, single-line for timestamp and sender.

**Implementation Options:**
Primary Approach: List item with leading icon (read/unread), primary text (message), and trailing text (timestamp).
Alternative Approaches:  Card-based notifications
Content Mapping: Message  "primary text", Timestamp  "secondary text", Read status  "leading icon"
Mobile Considerations:  Clear visual cues for unread notifications; efficient swipe-to-dismiss.

**Semantic Keywords:** notification, message, list, item, status, unread

**Component Fallback Strategy:**
Design System Priority: Medium
Fallback Guidance: If a specialized notification component is unavailable, use a standard list item with appropriate styling.



**Navigation Architecture**

**Inter-Section Navigation:**
Flow Pattern: Bottom navigation bar for easy switching between sections.
Entry Mechanisms:  Tab bar at the bottom of the screen.
Context Preservation:  Context is generally not preserved between sections; each section functions independently.


**Intra-Section Navigation:**
Content Discovery:  Scrolling, filtering (where applicable).
Task Completion:  Primary actions are clearly indicated within each section.


**Implementation Guidance**

**Content-to-Component Mapping:**
(Examples provided above in each functional area)


**Mobile Optimization Patterns:**
Touch Target Requirements: Minimum 44px for interactive elements, larger for primary actions (e.g., buttons).
Thumb Navigation Zones: Primary actions placed in the bottom third of the screen. Secondary actions higher up.
Content Scaling: Content adapts to different screen sizes through flexible layouts and responsive text sizing.


**Design System Flexibility:**
(Guidance provided above in each functional area, emphasizing flexibility)



**Success Validation**

(Success criteria outlined in the original brief are addressed within this specification through the focus on flexible implementation and mobile-first design principles.)
