**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout employs a vertical structure.  The hero image section uses a vertical container to ensure the image fills the available width. The content section below utilizes a vertical container with 16px spacing between elements for readability and visual separation.  All elements in the content section have default horizontal sizing (`AUTO`) unless otherwise specified.  The `horizontalSizing` property is set to `"FILL"` for the hero image (`native-rectangle`) to achieve the requested edge-to-edge visual impact.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward: users see the hero image, then key information (title, price, seller), followed by a clear call-to-action ("Contact Seller"). This linear progression prioritizes efficient information delivery and action completion.

4. **Component Choices:**  The design system lacks a dedicated "product detail screen" component. However, it does include components that can be used to assemble the desired layout. The `native-rectangle` component is selected for the hero image placeholder because it directly supports image fills and full-width sizing.  The `native-text` component will be used for titles, price, and location text. The `10:7773` (avatar / big) component is selected to display the seller's avatar due to its size and image fill capability. The `10:3907` (Button) component is best suited for the "Contact Seller" call to action due to its prominent design.  

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a single component to represent the entire product detail screen. While individual components (image, text, button, avatar) are present, no predefined combination caters specifically to this layout. To solve this, I employed a combination of native and existing components to achieve the desired structure and visual impact. This approach optimizes the user experience by utilizing the most efficient and visually appropriate components for each element.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through element size and placement. The full-width hero image holds the greatest visual prominence, followed by the product title (larger text size), price, and seller information.  The "Contact Seller" button is clearly highlighted by its color, design, and placement, guiding the user towards the primary action.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** The `native-rectangle` component does not have variants.  The Button component (`10:3907`) will use variants {"Platform": "Android+Web", "Size": "Medium", "Type": "Filled", "State": "Default", "Color": "Green"} to ensure it aligns with the overall design. This provides appropriate sizing and styling. The Avatar component (`10:7773`) will use variants {"Photo": "Yes"} to display the user's picture.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  I used a `native-rectangle` to act as a placeholder for the hero image, as the design system doesn't offer an appropriate pre-built image component with full-width support.  This native component effectively solves the requirement for a full-width hero image. I also used `native-text` for some text elements, since the design system text styles did not provide suitable hierarchy and sizing for the specific text components.
