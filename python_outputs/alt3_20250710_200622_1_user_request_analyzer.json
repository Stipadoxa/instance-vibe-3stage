Error state for password field clearly visible.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Sign in.\nSecondary Actions: Sign up.\nScreen States: Default state (with pre-filled email and empty password field), error state for password field.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback for error states (e.g., red border, error message), confirmation of successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n\n",
