**STAGE 3 NAVIGATION:**

Since the platform is unclear, I'll provide navigation options for both mobile and desktop:

**Mobile App Navigation:**

* Top Navigation: Back button (to return to previous search results or category page)
* Bottom Navigation: Home, Search, Favorites, Profile (Seller profile), Cart


**Desktop Web Navigation:**

* Header Navigation: Logo, Search bar, Categories, My Account (Login/Registration), Cart
* Sidebar Navigation (left-side):  Similar Listings, Seller's other items, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
