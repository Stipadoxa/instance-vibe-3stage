  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout is a single-column vertical stack, aligning with mobile best practices for readability and efficient use of screen real estate.  Fields are vertically stacked for a clear flow, with the primary action (login button) positioned below for immediate visibility and accessibility. Social login buttons are placed below the primary button, and the password recovery link is at the very bottom for easy access.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user flow is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. Users first enter their credentials, then tap the login button.  If they encounter errors, clear messages will guide them toward correction. Password recovery is accessible at the bottom of the form. Social login options provide alternative, faster authentication methods.",
    "componentChoices": "I chose the 'Button' component (id: 10:3907) for the login button, 'text input' component (id: 10:8492) for username/email and password fields, and 'text' (id: 24:10333) for the Terms & Conditions footnote. I considered using a 'chip' for social logins but opted against it as the design system's 'button' component offered better styling options for this purpose.  A simple 'text' component is sufficient for the T&C footnote, avoiding unnecessary visual complexity.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Visual hierarchy is established through component size and placement. The login button is more prominent due to its larger size ('Size':'Large' variant).  Spacing is used to visually separate sections (credentials, social logins, and footer). Typography follows mobile best practices; headings use larger font sizes than body text for improved scannability.",
    "variantSelectionRationale": "For the login button, I chose 'Size': 'Large', 'Type': 'Filled', 'State': 'Default', and 'Color': 'Green' because this provides sufficient tap target and conveys a sense of importance.  A filled button is more prominent than an outlined button.  The green color aligns with the design system's affirmative color palette. I did not select 'Disabled' or 'Progress' states as they're only relevant during interaction.  For text input fields, I selected 'State': 'enabled' and 'Type': 'Filled' to visually separate inputs from the rest of the screen. The 'enabled' state is appropriate because it's the default interactive state.  For the Terms & Conditions footnote, the default styling of the 'text' component is sufficient."
