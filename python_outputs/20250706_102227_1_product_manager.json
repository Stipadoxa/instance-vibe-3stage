  "content": "Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Product Search Results Page\n\n**Domain Analysis**\n\nPrimary Domain: E-commerce  Confidence Level: High (90%+)\nKey Evidence: \"product cards,\" \"search results page,\" \"filters\" are all strongly associated with e-commerce product browsing and filtering functionalities.  The request explicitly mentions \"product\" multiple times.\nAlternative Domains Considered: None. The terms used are directly indicative of an e-commerce context.  The request lacks any characteristics of other domains like finance (\"transactions,\" \"payments\"), healthcare (\"patient records\"), or education (\"courses,\" \"assignments\").\nValidation Check: The evidence strongly supports an e-commerce domain. The absence of keywords or context associated with other domains further solidifies this classification.\n\n\n**User Profile**\n\nPrimary Users:\n* Online Shoppers:  Individuals browsing and purchasing products online. Demographics will vary greatly depending on the specific product category (e.g., age, income, tech savviness).\n* Returning Customers: Existing users familiar with the site who are looking for specific products or categories.\n* First-time Visitors: New users exploring the website for the first time.\n\nUsage Context:\n* When:  Throughout the day, at any time convenient to the shopper.\n* Where:  On various devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone) in various locations (home, work, commute).\n* How:  Users will navigate to the search results page after entering search terms.  They will then interact with filters and browse product cards to find desired products.\n\nEnvironment:\n* Devices:  Responsive design is needed for desktop, tablet, and mobile.\n* Location:  Various - home, office, mobile.  Connectivity may be inconsistent.\n* Interruptions:  Users might be interrupted by other tasks or notifications.\n* Constraints:  Users may have limited time and attention spans.  Poor internet connectivity can negatively impact page load times.\n\nPrimary Goals:\n* Efficiently find desired products that match their search criteria.\n* Quickly compare and evaluate different products based on displayed information.\n* Proceed to the product page to learn more and ultimately purchase.\n\n\n**Core Use Cases**\n\n1. **Targeted Product Search:** A user searches for \"blue running shoes\" and uses the filters (size, brand) to narrow down the results, viewing product cards to compare options.\n\n2. **Filtering by Category and Price:** A user searches for \"headphones\" and uses the filters (price range, type) to quickly identify headphones within a specific budget and category.\n\n3. **Browsing Related Products:** After viewing a specific product card, a user explores other related products shown in the results.\n\n4. **Refining Search Results:** A user initially searches for \"dress shirts,\" gets too many results, and uses filters (color, size, brand) to refine the search and improve the relevance of results.\n\n5. **Handling No Results:** The user searches for a highly specific item and receives a \"No Results Found\" message with suggestions for alternative searches or related items.\n\n6. **Mobile Search:** A user uses their phone to search for a product during their lunch break, quickly evaluating a few product cards before committing to visit a product page.\n\n\n**Functional Requirements**\n\n1. **Search Functionality (Priority: Critical)**\n    * Purpose: Enables users to find desired products quickly.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Keyword-based search, auto-suggestions, search history, handling of typos and misspellings.\n    * Data Requirements:  Product catalog data (name, description, price, images, etc.), search index.\n    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the product catalog database and potentially a search engine API (e.g., Elasticsearch).\n\n\n2. **Filtering Functionality (Priority: High)**\n    * Purpose: Allows users to refine search results based on specific criteria.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Three horizontal filters (pre-defined, customizable),  dynamic update of results based on filter selections, clear filter selections.\n    * Data Requirements:  Product attribute data (e.g., size, color, brand, price range).\n    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the product catalog database.\n\n\n3. **Product Card Display (Priority: High)**\n    * Purpose: Presents concise information about products to aid in comparison.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Display of product image, name, price, short description.  \"Add to Cart\" functionality for each product.\n    * Data Requirements:  Product data (image URLs, names, prices, descriptions).\n    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the shopping cart system and product detail pages.\n\n\n4. **Pagination/Sorting (Priority: Medium)**\n    * Purpose: Enables efficient browsing of large result sets.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Pagination of search results, sorting options (e.g., price, relevance).\n    * Data Requirements:  Number of results, current page, sorting criteria.\n    * Integration Needs: None.\n\n\n5. **Error Handling (Priority: High)**\n    * Purpose: Gracefully handles unexpected situations.\n    * Core Capabilities:  Handle invalid searches, no results found messages, connection errors.\n    * Data Requirements:  Error messages and related data.\n    * Integration Needs: None.\n\n\n**Business Requirements**\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n* Increased conversion rates (products added to cart/purchases)\n* Improved average order value (AOV)\n* Reduced bounce rate from search results page\n* Increased search query volume\n* Improved customer satisfaction scores (CSAT)\n\nPerformance Targets:\n* Search results should load within 1 second.\n* Filter updates should be near-instantaneous.\n* Page load time should be under 3 seconds.\n* 99.9% uptime.\n\nCompliance:  PCI DSS compliance (if handling payment information directly on the page), GDPR compliance (if collecting user data).\n\n\n**User Experience Requirements**\n\nInformation Priority:  Product name, image, price should be most prominent.  Filter options and sorting should be clearly visible.\nInteraction Patterns:  Intuitive filtering mechanisms (dropdown menus, checkboxes), clear visual feedback on filter selections, smooth pagination.\nPlatform Constraints:  Responsive design for various screen sizes, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).\n\n\nThis PRD provides a comprehensive outline for the development of the enhanced search results page, minimizing ambiguity and allowing for efficient collaboration between product, design, and engineering teams.\n",
