Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access
User Type: Mobile application users attempting to log in
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a quick and secure login experience with a touch-friendly interface, considering limited screen real estate and potential interruptions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for faster access; recover forgotten credentials.
User Constraints: Limited screen size necessitates concise design; touch-only interaction; potential for interruptions; varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons and input fields) have appropriately sized touch targets; error states are clearly defined and communicated; visual hierarchy is clear, with the primary action (login button) most prominent; password recovery and terms & conditions are easily accessible.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field; password field; primary login button;  password recovery link; footnote regarding Terms & Conditions acceptance.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google);
Contextual: Error messages for invalid credentials; loading indicator during authentication.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single-column layout optimized for vertical scrolling on mobile. Input fields stacked vertically above the primary button. Social media login buttons placed below the primary button.  Password recovery and T&C links at the very bottom.
* Components: Input fields with appropriate keyboard types (email and password); a prominent primary "Login" button; smaller secondary buttons for social media login; hyperlinked text for password recovery and terms & conditions.
* Styling:  A consistent style should be maintained, reflecting the visual design language present in the provided reference image.  This includes a light-blue background, clear font choices, and the use of consistent spacing and padding.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login using credentials; initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Login via social media; review Terms & Conditions (T&C).
Screen States: Default (login form); loading (during authentication); error (invalid credentials); success (redirect to app).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format; clear and concise error messages for login failures; loading indicator during authentication; visual confirmation of successful login (redirect/transition).
