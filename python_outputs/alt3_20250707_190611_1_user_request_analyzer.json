  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Generic dialog system within a mobile application.  The specific context is unclear and requires further information.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to interact with system-level dialogs presenting information and requiring a decision.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users interact via touch, have limited screen real estate, and may be easily distracted.  The dialog should be concise and easy to understand.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Understand the information presented in the title and subtitle, and make a decision by interacting with the red button.\nSecondary Goals:  The dialog should be easy to dismiss (if applicable, method of dismissal needs clarification).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if: Title and subtitle text are clearly legible, the red button is appropriately sized for touch interaction, and the dialog's visual hierarchy is clear.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Title (short and descriptive), Subtitle (supplementary information), Red button (with clear label indicating action).\nSupporting:  None specified, but potentially an icon to represent the dialog's purpose.\nContextual: None specified.  Further information is needed to determine if the content changes based on different scenarios.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single-column layout, vertically stacking title, subtitle, and button.\n* Components:  Title (Text component), Subtitle (Text component), Red Button (Button component).\n* Styling: Button background color: Red.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Tap the red button.\nSecondary Actions:  Dismiss the dialog (method needs clarification - e.g., tap outside the dialog, back button).\nScreen States:  Only one state is specified - the default state with title, subtitle and button.\nFeedback Needs:  Visual feedback (e.g., button press state) on interaction with the button.  Haptic feedback may also be desirable.\n",
