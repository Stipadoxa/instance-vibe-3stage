Visual hierarchy prioritizes login functionality.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Email field (\"Your e-mail\" label, pre-filled with \"123@example.ua\"), password field (with error state and supportive text \"Please enter your password\"), \"Sign in\" button.\nSupporting: \"Sign up\" button, \"By continuing you agree to the Policy and Rules\" footnote with hyperlinked \"Policy\" and \"Rules\".\nContextual:  Error messages for invalid email or password.  Success message after successful login.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical layout with email field, password field, \"Sign in\" button, \"Sign up\" button, and footnote text in that order.\n*   **Components:** Email input field (pre-filled), Password input field (error state), Primary button (\"Sign in\"), Text button (\"Sign up\"), Footnote text with hyperlinked \"Policy\" and \"Rules\".\n*   **Styling:**  \"Sign in\" button styled as a primary button. \"Policy\" and \"Rules\" links styled in primary color.  Error state styling for password field.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Sign in.\nSecondary Actions: Sign up.\nScreen States: Default state (fields visible), error state (password field error), loading state (during authentication), success state (redirect or confirmation).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format (optional), clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, success confirmation.\n",
