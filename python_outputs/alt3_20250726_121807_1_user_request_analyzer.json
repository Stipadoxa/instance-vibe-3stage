  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user profile management and account settings.  Specific context is a mobile application with auction features.\nUser Type: Mobile users of a business/SaaS application who need to manage their profile, business information, auction access, and app preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive settings page with clear visual hierarchy due to screen size limitations.  Touch interaction will be primary.  The design must account for interruptions and potential distractions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Modify personal and business details, manage notification settings, change account security settings (password), and log out of the application.\nSecondary Goals: View auction access status, display verification badge, change language and contact preferences, disable in-app communication features (chats/feedback).  Delete account (this should ideally require confirmation).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile, reliance on touch interactions, potential for interruptions, and varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All settings options are clearly labelled and accessible via touch targets that meet minimum size requirements.  Top and bottom navigation is implemented and functions correctly.  A clear visual hierarchy guides the user through the various settings.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (editable), business details (editable), auction access status indicator (read-only), verified badge (visual indicator), change phone number option, change email address option, change language option, disable chats option, disable feedback option, manage notifications option, change password option, delete account option, logout button.\nSupporting:  Clear labels for each setting option, visual indicators of input validation (e.g., checkmarks, error messages), confirmation dialog for delete account.\nContextual:  Loading indicators for asynchronous operations (e.g., saving changes), success/error messages after changes.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical scrolling list of settings options, separated into logical groups (e.g., Personal, Business, Account, Notifications, etc.).\n*   **Components:** Top navigation bar (likely with a back button), individual setting rows (each with a label and input/toggle), bottom navigation bar (app-wide navigation).  Each setting row should use appropriate input controls (text fields, toggles, dropdown menus).\n*   **Styling:**  Consistent styling with the rest of the mobile application.  Clear visual distinction between setting categories.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Save changes, change password, logout, delete account.\nSecondary Actions: View auction access, enable/disable chats/feedback, manage notification settings.\nScreen States: Default state (displaying current settings), loading state (while saving changes), success state (after successful save), error state (if changes fail to save), confirmation dialog (before deleting account).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for input fields, clear success/error messages after saving changes, visual indication of loading, confirmation before deleting the account.\n",
