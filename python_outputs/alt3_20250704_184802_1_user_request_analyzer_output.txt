Domain & Context

Domain: E-commerce domain specifically for food delivery services.
User Type: Mobile users seeking to order food, groceries, or other goods for delivery.  Users may be at home, work, or elsewhere, potentially facing distractions and limited attention spans.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a visually appealing, intuitive homepage with large touch targets and quick access to key functionalities.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring prioritization of content and efficient use of space.

User Requirements

Primary Goals: Quickly browse available food and delivery options, initiate a search for specific items or restaurants, and begin the ordering process.
Secondary Goals: Discover new restaurants or services, utilize loyalty points, check current location services,  and understand available delivery categories.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential distractions, varying network conditions, and competing notifications.

Ready for handoff if:  Primary action (initiate search or select a category) is clearly prominent,  all elements (header, hero, category cards, services) are appropriately sized for touch interaction,  and visual hierarchy guides usersâ€™ attention efficiently. Category cards and service cards have clear visual distinctions.

Content Requirements

Critical:  Current location (with option to change), search bar, category cards (restaurants, grocery, etc.),  "See all" links for each category, hero banner image showcasing popular items,  points balance display.
Supporting:  "24/7" and "New" badges on relevant category cards or service cards,  a visually appealing and easily understood presentation of provider cards in the services section.
Contextual:  Personalized recommendations (based on past orders or location),  notifications of new promotions or offers,  error messages regarding location services or network connectivity.


Screen Requirements

Primary Actions: Initiate a search, select a category card to browse options, tap a service provider card to view details.
Secondary Actions: Change location, view points details, access the bottom navigation tabs (Account, Orders, etc. - these are implied by the specification).
Screen States: Default state (initial load), loading state (while fetching data), error state (location not found, network error), search results state.
Feedback Needs: Clear visual feedback (e.g., loading indicator) during data retrieval,  error messages providing helpful instructions for resolving issues, and real-time updates to the search results as text input changes.
