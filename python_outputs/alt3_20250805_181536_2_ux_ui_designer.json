  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical `layoutContainer` as the root, providing a clear top-to-bottom flow for the notification settings. Each notification type is presented as a separate `layoutContainer` with horizontal alignment, placing the label and toggle switch side-by-side.  A small vertical spacing is added between each notification setting item for visual separation.  The `horizontalSizing` property is not used since the items do not need to fill the entire width.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward. Users can easily scan the list of notification types, check their current status (on/off), and toggle them using the switch. The descriptive text associated with each toggle helps users understand the meaning of each notification type.\n\n4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:9912` (switch) component for toggles because it's designed specifically for on/off controls, aligns directly with the user requirement for enabling or disabling each notification type, and offers a clear visual representation of the current state.  Alternatives considered were `10:9586` (checkboxes) and `10:9825` (radio buttons), but these are not optimal for simple on/off choices, leading to a less intuitive user experience in this context.\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a pre-built component to directly represent a list-item with an associated toggle switch and description. The `10:10214` (list-item) component would be ideal for the structure, but it doesn't directly accommodate this particular combination of UI elements. I created a workaround using a combination of a horizontal `layoutContainer` for each notification item to accommodate the label (`native-text`), and the `10:9912` (switch) component which provide a structured visual layout while maintaining component-based interactions. This approach provides a cleaner, more readable user interface than using only native elements, and satisfies the user's requirement for an organized listing of notification settings.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through consistent spacing between the list items and a clear left-alignment of labels and toggles.  The notification types are ordered naturally, and using the standard `Body/Medium` text style ensures visual consistency.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** The `10:9912` (switch) component uses the `State: enabled` variant for all toggles to indicate an active and responsive interface. The `Selected` variant will dynamically reflect the user's choice (true/false), providing immediate feedback. No other state variants are needed for this particular use case.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:**  To render labels for each notification type, I used `native-text` elements with the \"Body/Medium\" text style from the design system. This is necessary because while `10:10214` (list-item) could be used for layout,  there is no available component to directly embed both the toggle switch and the descriptive text beside it within a list item. Therefore, the `native-text` element is used to fill this functional gap and complement the existing component structure.\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Notification Settings Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 16, \"paddingBottom\": 16, \"paddingLeft\": 16, \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\", \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"layoutContainer\": {\n          \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n          \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"native-text\",\n              \"properties\": {\n                \"content\": \"Push Notifications\",\n                \"textStyle\": \"Body/Medium\",\n                \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral50\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"component\",\n              \"id\": \"10:9912\",\n              \"variants\": {\n                \"State\": \"enabled\",\n                \"Selected\": \"false\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"layoutContainer\": {\n          \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n          \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"native-text\",\n              \"properties\": {\n                \"content\": \"Email Alerts\",\n                \"textStyle\": \"Body/Medium\",\n                \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral50\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"component\",\n              \"id\": \"10:9912\",\n              \"variants\": {\n                \"State\": \"enabled\",\n                \"Selected\": \"false\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"layoutContainer\": {\n          \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n          \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"native-text\",\n              \"properties\": {\n                \"content\": \"SMS Updates\",\n                \"textStyle\": \"Body/Medium\",\n                \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral50\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"component\",\n              \"id\": \"10:9912\",\n              \"variants\": {\n                \"State\": \"enabled\",\n                \"Selected\": \"false\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"layoutContainer\": {\n          \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n          \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"native-text\",\n              \"properties\": {\n                \"content\": \"Promotional Offers\",\n                \"textStyle\": \"Body/Medium\",\n                \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral50\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"component\",\n              \"id\": \"10:9912\",\n              \"variants\": {\n                \"State\": \"enabled\",\n                \"Selected\": \"false\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
