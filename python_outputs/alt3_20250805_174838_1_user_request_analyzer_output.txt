**Input:** "I need a user profile page where users can see their order history, update their profile information (name, email, address), and change their password.  It should use a grid layout to organize the information neatly.  Show order dates and order IDs in the order history.  The page should also include a section to display their average star rating from past reviews (using star icons).  We need this for both desktop and mobile."

**Output:**
