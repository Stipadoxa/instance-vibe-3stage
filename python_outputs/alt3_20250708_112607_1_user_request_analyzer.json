  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Onboarding domain for a mobile application\nUser Type: First-time and returning mobile app users\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users expect a simple, visually appealing, and quick onboarding experience. Limited screen real estate necessitates concise content and clear calls to action.  Touch interaction needs to be considered in button and text link sizing.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Begin using the app, understand the next steps.\nSecondary Goals: Option to skip the welcome screen and access the app directly.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch interaction, potential for distractions.\nReady for handoff if: All specified content elements are present,  the \"Get Started\" button is appropriately sized and prominent,  the \"Skip for now\" link is clearly visible and distinguishable from the button, and the overall design adheres to the specified color scheme and feels welcoming.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: \"Welcome Back!\" title (primary green), \"Ready to get started?\" subtitle (neutral gray), \"Get Started\" button, simple divider line (neutral color).\nSupporting: \"Skip for now\" text link (secondary orange).\nContextual: None specified.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single screen, likely vertically stacked elements.  Specific layout will depend on the app's design system,  but should be visually balanced.\n* Components: Title (Text component, primary green), Subtitle (Text component, neutral gray), Button (\"Get Started\"), Text link (\"Skip for now\", secondary orange), Divider (Line component, neutral color).\n* Styling:  Colors should conform to the app's design system.  The \"Get Started\" button should have clear visual hierarchy.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Tap \"Get Started\" button.\nSecondary Actions: Tap \"Skip for now\" link.\nScreen States:  Only one state is specified.\nFeedback Needs: No specific feedback mechanisms are required beyond visual confirmation of button and link taps.\n",
