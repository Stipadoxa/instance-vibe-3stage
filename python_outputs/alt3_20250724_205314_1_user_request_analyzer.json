Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information architecture.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal and business details; manage account preferences (notifications, chats); manage security settings (password, account deletion); log out of the application.\nSecondary Goals:  Understand the meaning of \"Verified ID\" badge; easily access support/help resources.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions during use, limited attention span.\nReady for handoff if: All settings options from the reference image are present and functional, navigation is intuitive and consistent with the app's design system, all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes, and text is legible.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details section (editable fields for relevant information), Business details section (editable fields for relevant information), Access to Cars45 auction toggle (Active/Inactive state), \"Verified ID\" badge section with explanation, Change phone number option, Change email option, Change language option, Disable chats toggle, Disable Feedback toggle, Manage notifications option, Change password option, Delete my account permanently option, Log out option.\nSupporting:  Clear visual indicators of active/inactive toggles.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid inputs, loading indicators for actions that require server-side processing, confirmation dialogs before irreversible actions (e.g., deleting an account).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  List-based layout similar to the reference image; top and bottom app navigation bars as specified.\n* Components:  Use existing app components (as specified); each setting option should be presented as a row in a list, including labels and appropriate interactive elements (e.g., text fields, toggles).  Right-aligned indicators for status (e.g., \"Active,\" \"What is it?\").\n* Styling:  Adhere to the existing app's color scheme and styling guidelines (as informed by the reference image).\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Tap on a setting option to access/modify it; tap \"Log out.\"\nSecondary Actions:  Tap \"What is it?\" for clarifications; navigate to help/support.\nScreen States: Default state (all settings displayed), loading state (when updating information), error state (if an error occurs during modification), success state (after successful modification).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indicators of changes made (e.g., checkmarks), informative error messages, loading indicators for long-running operations.\n\n",
