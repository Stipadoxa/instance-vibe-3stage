Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of information.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Quickly assess notification importance, potentially interact with notifications (e.g., mark as read, dismiss).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, interruptions are common while using the app.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp. Top bar with user info and bottom navigation are present and functional.  Touch targets are appropriately sized.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in the top bar.\nSupporting:  Number of unread notifications (potentially displayed in top bar).\nContextual:  Visual indicator of notification status (e.g., read/unread).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, Top bar at the top, Bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Top bar (includes user info), Notification item component (includes user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom navigation (with unspecified number of tabs).\n* Styling:  (Unspecified, requires further design decisions)\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details.\nSecondary Actions: Mark as read, Dismiss notification (these actions may be implicit or explicit, requiring further design decisions).\nScreen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (while fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual cues for read/unread notifications, loading indicator when fetching notifications.\n",
