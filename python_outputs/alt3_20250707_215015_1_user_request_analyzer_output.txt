Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface; limited screen real estate necessitates efficient design.  The yellow background needs to be considered for accessibility and visual appeal.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account
Secondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable within the design system)
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential accessibility issues with yellow background.
Ready for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link (if included) is clearly visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, color contrast meets accessibility guidelines.


Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area
Supporting: Password recovery link (if included per design system),  "Remember me" option (if included per design system)
Contextual: Loading indicator during authentication,  error messages for invalid credentials, success confirmation


Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:**  Single-column form layout optimized for mobile.
*   **Components:**  Text input fields for username/email and password;  button for login;  link for password recovery (if included per design system);  potentially a "remember me" checkbox (if included per design system).  Error message display area below form fields.
*   **Styling:** Background color: Yellow (specific shade defined by design system);  all other colors and styles defined by design system.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery (if applicable)
Secondary Actions:  None specified, but could include "create account" link depending on design system.
Screen States: Default state, loading state, error state, success state.
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.
