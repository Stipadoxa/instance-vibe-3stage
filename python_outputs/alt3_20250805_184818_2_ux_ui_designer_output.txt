I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout utilizes a vertical layout container as the root, providing a clear top-to-bottom flow. The search bar and filter button occupy the top section, followed by a horizontally wrapped layout container for the product cards.  This wrap ensures responsive behavior across different screen sizes.  Spacing between items is consistent (16px). Full-width elements like product card images utilize `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to stretch to the available width.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is designed for efficient product discovery.  The search bar enables quick searches, while the filter button allows for refined results. The grid layout provides an easily scannable view of products.  Each product card offers essential information, allowing the user to make informed decisions.

4. **Component Choices:**
    - **`10:12086` (searchbar):** Chosen over potentially creating a custom search bar using native elements because it provides a consistent and ready-to-use search input field integrated with the design system.
    - **`10:3907` (button):** Selected for the filter button because it offers a standard button component with appropriate styling and interaction. I considered no button at all, or a custom button made from native elements. However, using the pre-built button ensures design consistency and reduces development effort.
    - **`147:3743` (product card):** This component is ideal for displaying product information concisely. Alternatives such as custom layouts using native elements were considered, but the product card provides a more structured and visually appealing presentation.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated rating component (`native-rating` is forbidden).  Therefore, a workaround has been implemented using multiple instances of the `635:4752` (star) icon component to visually represent seller ratings. This approach maintains a consistent visual style while respecting the constraints.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Prominence is established through the size and positioning of elements. The search bar and filter button are at the top, clearly visible.  Product card titles are larger and bolder than other information within the cards.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** Variants are chosen to be consistent with the design system defaults.  For example, the Button component uses default size and type.  Product card variants are set as needed.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  Due to the absence of a suitable "grid layout" component in the design system (`native-grid` is forbidden) the `layoutContainer` with `layoutWrap: "WRAP"` is used to create the product card grid layout. The use of `native-rectangle` components with image fills caters to the product image requirement.
