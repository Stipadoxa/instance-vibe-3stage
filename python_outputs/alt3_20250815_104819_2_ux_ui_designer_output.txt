## SECTION 1: DESIGN RATIONALE

# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied

- **Typography Hierarchy**: The design leverages the provided typography system to ensure clear visual hierarchy.  The seller's name ("EcoFriendlyGoods") is styled with `Title/Medium` for prominence within the row. The seller rating ("4.8 (1234)") uses `Body/Medium` for secondary importance, ensuring it's readable but doesn't compete with the seller's name.

- **Spacing System**:  The horizontal layout uses `itemSpacing: 8` between the avatar, seller name, and rating, creating a visually cohesive unit.  The entire row, acting as a tappable area, utilizes the standard horizontal padding of `16px` on each side as defined in the design system for content containers. This ensures sufficient tappable area for touch-friendly interactions on mobile.

- **Component Behavior**:  Given the lack of a suitable pre-existing component in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`, a `layoutContainer` with a `HORIZONTAL` layout mode is used as a fallback.  This allows for the flexible arrangement of the avatar (using `native-image`), seller name (`native-text`), and rating (`native-text`). The entire `layoutContainer` is made tappable, acting as the navigation to the seller's profile.


- **Color Application**: The background color of the `layoutContainer` is set to `"White/white100"` for optimal readability and consistency with the overall app theme. The text colors for both the seller name and rating adhere to the system styles `"Title/Medium"` and `"Body/Medium"` respectively.  These styles already incorporate appropriate neutral colors from the design system.

- **Layout Strategy**: A `HORIZONTAL` `layoutContainer` is employed to align the avatar, seller name, and rating horizontally, mirroring typical e-commerce seller information display patterns. The `primaryAxisSizingMode` is set to `"AUTO"` to allow the row to adapt to the length of the seller's name.  The `counterAxisSizingMode` is `"FIXED"` to maintain consistent height.

## Domain Context Integration

- **Industry Patterns**: The design mirrors common e-commerce practices by displaying seller information concisely, prioritizing seller name and rating for quick user assessment.  The use of an avatar image adds a personal touch and enhances trust.

- **User Mental Models**: The horizontal arrangement of elements is intuitive, following the user's left-to-right reading pattern. This layout is consistent with how users expect to see seller information presented on similar e-commerce platforms.

- **Contextual Adaptations**: The design is adapted to the specific context of displaying seller information within a product listing or search results. The absence of a heading is deliberate, as this row is a child element within a larger interface, preventing unnecessary repetition.  The entire row acts as a direct navigation element to the seller profile, streamlining the user journey.

## Design System Compliance

- **Component Verification**:  While a dedicated "seller-info" component isn't available, the fallback using `layoutContainer` and `native` elements ensures complete functionality and adheres to design system principles.  All referenced components (`native-image`, `native-text`) and styles are verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

- **Variant Completeness**:  The chosen approach doesn't use predefined component variants, thus this criterion is not applicable.

- **Text Property Mapping**: The design uses native-text elements, mapping content directly to appropriate textStyle names from the design system.

- **Schema Adherence**: The `layoutContainer` and `native-text` elements precisely follow their respective schemas in the output JSON.
