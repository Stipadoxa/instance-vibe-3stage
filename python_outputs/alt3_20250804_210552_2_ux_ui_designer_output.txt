I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure.  The search bar and filter button occupy the app bar at the top. The product cards are arranged in a grid layout using a `native-grid` to ensure responsiveness.  The `itemSpacing` is set to 8 for visual breathing room between product cards.  `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` is used for the product image within the card.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first sees the search bar to input their query. Then, they can use the filter button to refine the results. The main content area displays products using a grid for optimal visual scannability.  Each product card provides all necessary information for quick decision-making.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:12086` (searchbar) component for the search bar as it provides built-in functionality and styling. I chose `10:3907` (button) for the Filter button due to its flexibility in styling and states. For the product cards, I couldn't find a suitable component that could combine the image, title, price, and rating. Thus, I created a custom layout for the card.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a combined "product card" component.  To achieve this, I used a combination of the `147:3743` (product card)  component, a `native-rectangle` for the image placeholder, and `native-text` elements for the title, price, and rating.  This workaround allows for a consistent look and feel while fulfilling the specific functional requirements.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The search bar and filter button have the highest visual prominence due to their placement in the app bar. The product cards are arranged in a grid with clear spacing, promoting visual scanning and comparison.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the button component (`10:3907`), I used the "Medium" size for optimal readability on different screen sizes.  I considered the "large" and "small" sizes, but medium strikes a balance between readability and minimizing space usage.  The "Filled" type is selected for high visual contrast and to indicate its action.


8. **Native Element Justification:**  A suitable "product card" component wasn't available in the design system. To achieve the required layout for displaying product details including image, title, price and rating, a `native-grid` was used for the product card layout to create the necessary structure and manage the responsive behavior of the grid based on the screen size. `native-rectangle` was used for the product image placeholder and `native-text` for title, price and rating. This approach offers a flexible, responsive, and functional workaround.
