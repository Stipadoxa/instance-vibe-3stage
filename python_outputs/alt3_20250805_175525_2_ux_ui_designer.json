  "content": "**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to naturally guide the user down the form.  Each input field and the button are given ample spacing (16px) for visual clarity and to prevent a cramped feel. The \"Forgot Password\" link is positioned below the login button, maintaining a logical flow.  The `horizontalSizing: \"FILL\"` property ensures that all input fields span the full width of their containers, consistent with standard mobile form design.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward and intuitive.  The user first enters their email, then their password, and finally clicks the \"Login\" button.  The \"Forgot Password\" link provides a clear escape route if the user needs to reset their credentials.\n\n4. **Component Choices:**\n    * **Email Input Field:** I chose the `text input` component (ID: `10:8492`) for both email and password fields because it provides a clear and concise form element with built-in placeholder text and feedback mechanisms for the user.  I considered using a custom `native-text` element for the input fields, but the `text input` component offers more user-friendly features out-of-the-box, like autocorrect and secure input for passwords. It offers superior usability compared to a plain `native-text` element. I didn't need the Label since placeholders already exist in the component.\n    * **Password Input Field:** The `text input` component handles password security natively. No need to implement manual secure input handling through native elements.\n    * **Login Button:** I chose the `Button` component (ID: `10:3907`) because it's a standard component in the design system. I used the Filled variant in Green for high visibility and positive reinforcement. Alternatives like outlined or text buttons were less suitable here. I could have potentially built this from native rectangles, but the button component offers a much more polished visual style.\n    * **Forgot Password Link:**  I chose a `native-text` element for the \"Forgot Password?\" link because the design system doesn't offer a dedicated hyperlink component. This allows me to style the link appropriately and trigger a navigation action when tapped.\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated \"login screen\" component and a \"Forgot Password\" link component.  For the \"Forgot Password?\" link, I used a `native-text` element styled as a link to create a semantic equivalent and functionality. This is a simple and effective workaround, fully compliant with the renderer's capabilities.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through component sizing, spacing, and color. The input fields have a clear visual grouping. The Login button has higher visual weight due to its size and color. The \"Forgot Password\" link has a lower visual weight but remains distinct by using a visually separate element, providing clear visual separation in the structure.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**\n    * **Login Button:** I chose the `Color: Green` variant for the Login button to improve visual prominence and to suggest a positive action. This enhances the user experience by making the most crucial component of the form stand out.\n    * **Input Fields:**  I selected the enabled state for both input fields and the default state for the button.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:** A native text element was used for the “Forgot Password?” link because a hyperlink component was not found in the provided design system. The native text element can easily achieve the required styling and functionality.\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Marketplace Login Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 32, \"paddingBottom\": 32, \"paddingLeft\": 16, \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\", \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:8492\",\n        \"name\": \"Email Input\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"enabled\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"placeholder-text\": \"Email Address\",\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:8492\",\n        \"name\": \"Password Input\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"enabled\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"placeholder-text\": \"Password\",\n          \"isPassword\": true,\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n        \"name\": \"Login Button\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n          \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"Default\",\n          \"Color\": \"Green\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"Action\": \"Login\",\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"native-text\",\n        \"name\": \"Forgot Password Link\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"content\": \"Forgot Password?\",\n          \"textStyle\": \"Body/Small\",\n          \"color\": \"Tertiary/tertiary50\",\n          \"alignment\": \"center\",\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
