Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management
User Type: Mobile users managing their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily navigable settings screen with clear touch targets and minimal scrolling.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of settings.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify personal and business details, manage notification preferences, securely change account credentials, and log out of the application.
Secondary Goals:  Easily disable features (chats and feedback), delete account (carefully guided process).
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, users may be unfamiliar with some settings.
Ready for handoff if: All settings are clearly labeled and accessible, actions are confirmed before execution (especially account deletion), top and bottom app bars are implemented, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.


Content Requirements
Critical: Personal details (view and edit), business details (view and edit), change phone number, change email, change language, change password, log out.
Supporting: Disable chats, disable feedback, manage notifications.
Contextual:  Confirmation dialog before account deletion, success/error messages for setting changes, loading indicators during data saving.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list of settings items.  Items should be grouped logically (e.g., Personal, Business, Account).
* Components: Top app bar (with back button), list items (each with label and potentially a right-pointing arrow or toggle), bottom app bar (potentially with a save button if settings are not auto-saved).
* Styling: Consistent with overall app styling guidelines.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Modify settings, log out.
Secondary Actions:  Navigate to detailed views for specific settings (e.g., Manage Notifications).
Screen States: Default state, loading state (when saving changes), success state (after saving changes), error state (if changes fail).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual cues for successful setting changes, appropriate loading indicators, informative error messages.
