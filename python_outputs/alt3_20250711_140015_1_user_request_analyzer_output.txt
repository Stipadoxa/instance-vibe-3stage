Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication and User Profile Management within a mobile application
User Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings, view profile information, and control notification preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise settings page with clear visual hierarchy and easily accessible controls due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  They may be in distracting environments and prefer quick access to core functionalities.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View and update user profile information, manage notification preferences, log out of the application securely.
Secondary Goals: Access help or support resources related to account settings.
User Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile devices, touch-only interaction, potential interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All primary actions (profile view, notification toggle, logout) are clearly visible and easily accessible via touch targets;  a clear visual hierarchy guides the user through the settings;  error states are anticipated and accounted for.

Content Requirements
Critical: User profile information (name, email, etc.), notification toggle switch (on/off), logout button.
Supporting:  Help/support link, version number of the application.
Contextual:  Error messages (e.g., for network issues during profile updates), success messages (e.g., after logging out), loading indicators (e.g., when saving profile changes).

Structural & Component Directives

*   **Layout:** Single-column layout optimized for vertical scrolling on mobile. Sections clearly separated with appropriate headings.
*   **Components:** Profile section (with editable fields or view-only fields depending on design choices), Toggle switch for notifications, Logout button styled as a destructive action (e.g., red background), Help icon or link.
*   **Styling:**  Consistent with overall app branding, clear visual hierarchy using headings, spacing, and potentially subtle visual separators between sections.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View/edit profile, toggle notifications, log out.
Secondary Actions: Access help/support.
Screen States: Default state (showing profile and settings), loading state (while saving changes), error state (if changes fail to save).
Feedback Needs: Visual feedback (e.g., checkmark) after successful changes, clear error messages with guidance on how to resolve issues.
