  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Onboarding domain for mobile application\nUser Type: First-time users launching the mobile application\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users expect a concise and visually appealing welcome screen, optimized for touch interaction and limited screen real estate.  The screen should load quickly and be easily navigable.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Acknowledge successful app launch, introduce the app's purpose briefly.\nSecondary Goals:  Guide users to the next step in the onboarding process (e.g., login/registration, tutorial).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during launch.\nReady for handoff if: The \"Welcome to our app\" text is clearly visible and legible,  a clear call to action (CTA) button is present to guide users to the next screen, and the screen loads quickly without errors.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  \"Welcome to our app\" text (green).\nSupporting:  App logo (optional, depending on branding guidelines),  CTA button (\"Get Started,\" \"Continue,\" etc.).\nContextual:  None (for a simple welcome screen).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single screen, centered text.\n* Components:  Text element (\"Welcome to our app\"), CTA button.\n* Styling:  Text color: Green.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Proceed to the next screen (e.g., login, tutorial).\nSecondary Actions: None (for a simple welcome screen).\nScreen States:  Single state (always displays the welcome message).\nFeedback Needs:  None (beyond successful loading of the screen).\n",
