  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout is organized vertically, prioritizing the hero image at the top, followed by product details and a prominent CTA button. Top and bottom navigation bars ensure easy screen transitions.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user journey is designed to be seamless, starting with a visually appealing hero image, followed by clear product information, ending with a highly visible 'Contact Seller' button. The navigation bars allow for smooth transition to other parts of the app.",
    "componentChoices": "I chose 'Image Carousel' for showcasing product photos instead of 'Image' and 'Gallery' because it allows for multiple images and better visual presentation on mobile.  'Text Fields' are selected to display product details instead of 'Text' and 'Card' to accommodate multiple information fields effectively. The 'Button' is chosen to provide clear call to action to contact the seller rather than using a 'Link' or a 'Text'. Top and Bottom Navigation bars are chosen over 'Tab' as the requirement specifies top and bottom and 'Tab' is more suitable for content navigation within the same page.",
    "visualHierarchy": "The hero image is prominently displayed to attract user attention.  Product title, price and the 'Contact Seller' button is given more visual prominence than the seller information, helping the user focus on key information.",
    "variantSelectionRationale": "For the 'Contact Seller' button, I selected 'Size: Large', 'Type: Filled', and 'Color: Green' to emphasize its importance and adherence to the design system's convention on usage of primary color green for CTA buttons. The default state is selected as the button is always enabled. 'Android+Web' variant is used for the platform compatibility.",
    "colorSelectionRationale": "Selected color style 'Primary/primary50' from colorStyles.primary for the 'Contact Seller' button to align with the design system's CTA conventions.  The green color is used as a primary color across design system for CTA elements.",
    "nativeElementJustification": "With moment significance of 0.7 and 'impress, guide, convert' emotional intent, this Product Detail Page warrants expressive treatment. A native rectangle with a subtle background gradient enhances the hero section, creating visual appeal and making the product stand out. Native circles can be used as a decorative elements."
