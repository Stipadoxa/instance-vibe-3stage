  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Generic application domain with an existing UI element (\"test\").  The context suggests a simple UI with a boolean value.\nUser Type: Mobile users interacting with a simple application.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform constraints necessitate concise UI, large touch targets, and consideration for interruptions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals:  Interact with the application and utilize a newly added functionality (the button).\nSecondary Goals: Maintain the existing functionality represented by the `{\"test\": true}` JSON.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if: The button is clearly visible, appropriately sized for touch interaction, and its functionality is defined and integrated without disrupting the existing \"test\" functionality.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: The existing JSON data (`{\"test\": true}`) must be retained.  A new button element must be added.\nSupporting:  Clear visual indication of the button's purpose.\nContextual:  The button's behavior might change based on the state of `{\"test\": true}` (although this is not specified).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  The existing layout needs to accommodate a new button element without significant restructuring.  The placement of the button should be determined based on usability best practices for mobile.\n* Components:  A new button component needs to be added.  Specific styling (size, color, label) needs to be determined.\n* Styling: The button styling should align with existing mobile UI guidelines to maintain consistency.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Interact with the new button.\nSecondary Actions:  Interact with any existing functionality implied by `{\"test\": true}` (this needs clarification).\nScreen States: At least two states â€“ one before the button interaction and one after.\nFeedback Needs: Visual feedback (e.g., state change) after the button is pressed.  Error handling if applicable.\n",
