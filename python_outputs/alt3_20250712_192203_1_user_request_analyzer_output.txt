Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile app users who need to view and manage their notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates a concise layout, intuitive touch interactions, and consideration for limited screen real estate.  Notifications must be easily scannable due to potential interruptions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals:  Navigate to the source of a notification (if applicable), mark notifications as read, potentially manage notification settings (though this might be a separate screen).
User Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch interactions, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if:  All notification items display correctly with image, title, subtitle, and timestamp;  navigation is clear and intuitive;  touch targets are appropriately sized.


Content Requirements
Critical: List of notifications (image, title, subtitle, timestamp).
Supporting:  Notification count indicator (in app icon or elsewhere).
Contextual:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., bolding, visual cue).


Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** Vertical list of notifications, possibly grouped by type or date.
*   **Components:** Top app bar (likely with title and back button), list items (image, title, subtitle, timestamp), bottom navigation bar (with other app sections).
*   **Styling:**  Consistent with overall app styling, clear visual separation between notification items.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on an item).
Secondary Actions: Mark notifications as read (swipe action, check box, etc.).
Screen States:  Default (showing a list of notifications), Empty state (no notifications), Loading state (fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual indication of read/unread status, loading indicator while fetching new notifications, confirmation that a notification has been marked as read.
