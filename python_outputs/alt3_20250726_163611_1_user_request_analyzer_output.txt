Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and information through notifications.
Platform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of information; touch interactions require clear, large targets; interruptions are common, requiring concise and easily digestible information; location awareness may not be directly relevant to notifications.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View recent notifications, understand notification content (title, description), and track timestamp.
Secondary Goals: Potentially access associated content related to the notification through implicit or explicit action.
User Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile; need for clear visual hierarchy due to multiple notifications; potential for a large number of notifications needing efficient presentation.
Ready for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar displays user information; bottom navigation is present and functional; touch targets are appropriately sized.


Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the five notifications).
Supporting:  Number of unread notifications (if applicable, shown in top bar or as a badge).
Contextual:  Indication of whether a notification has been read (e.g., visual cue).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, each notification item having a single row or a compact multi-line layout.
* Components: Top bar (user info and potentially unread count), Notification Item (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom navigation bar.
* Styling: Consistent styling across all notification items; clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification item).
Secondary Actions: Potentially mark notifications as read (implicitly or explicitly).
Screen States: Default (showing notifications), loading state (if notifications are being fetched).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual cues for read/unread notifications; loading indicator while fetching notifications.
