Domain & Context
Domain:  Notification management within a mobile application
User Type: Mobile app users receiving and interacting with notifications.
Platform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of information.  Touch interaction is primary; design must account for finger-sized tap targets.  Notifications are likely to be viewed in short bursts, amidst other app usage.


User Requirements
Primary Goals: View the most recent notification.
Secondary Goals:  Access further notifications (if available beyond the single shown), potentially dismiss the notification.
User Constraints: Small screen size, reliance on touch input, brief interaction time, potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if:  The single notification item is clearly visible and easy to interact with. The top app bar and bottom navigation are functional and do not obstruct the notification.  Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.


Content Requirements
Critical: One notification item (containing at least a title and a short preview of the notification content).
Supporting:  None explicitly specified, but potentially a timestamp or sender information within the notification item.
Contextual:  Indicator of unread notifications (if applicable).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single notification displayed prominently; Top app bar at the top; Bottom navigation at the bottom.
* Components: Top app bar, single notification item (with title and preview text, minimally), bottom navigation.
* Styling:  Not specified.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  View notification details (tapping the notification item).  Possibly dismiss the notification (by swipe or button).
Secondary Actions:  None explicitly specified, but may include accessing other notifications.
Screen States:  Default (showing one notification); potentially loading state if fetching notifications.
Feedback Needs:  Visual feedback when the notification is interacted with (e.g., a change in appearance).
