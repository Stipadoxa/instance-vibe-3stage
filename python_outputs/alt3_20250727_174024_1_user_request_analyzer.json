  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and all fields are accessible via keyboard.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Email field, password field, login button, error message area.\nSupporting: Password recovery link,  \"Remember me\" checkbox (optional).\nContextual: Loading indicator during authentication,  specific error messages for invalid credentials (e.g., \"Incorrect email or password\").\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions:  Access account creation (link to registration page), access help/support (link or icon).\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (incorrect credentials), success state (redirect to account dashboard).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual feedback upon successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n\n**Structural & Component Directives**\n*Layout: Single column layout to maximize vertical space.*\n*Components:  Email input field (with email validation), password input field (with password visibility toggle), login button (prominent), password recovery link (subtle but clear), potentially a \"Remember me\" checkbox.*\n*Styling:  Use clear and consistent visual hierarchy.  Button should have sufficient tap target size for mobile usability.*\n\n",
