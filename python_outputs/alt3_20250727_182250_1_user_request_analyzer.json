  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain for mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and notifications\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need concise notification summaries, easily scannable information, and intuitive touch interactions.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information presentation.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, understand notification content (title, description), track notification timestamps.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially navigate to the source of the notification from the notification itself.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile,  touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.  Users need to quickly assess the importance of each notification.\nReady for handoff if: All five notification items are clearly visible and easily distinguishable.  Top bar and bottom navigation are functional and visually integrated. Touch targets meet minimum size requirements.  Visual hierarchy clearly prioritizes important information (e.g., title over description).\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of 5 notifications), user information in top bar.\nSupporting:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., badge count).\nContextual:  Empty state message (if no notifications),  \"Load more\" indication if there are more notifications than displayed.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  List view for notifications, potentially vertically scrollable if more than 5 notifications are possible.\n* Components: Top bar (containing user info), individual notification item components (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), bottom navigation bar.\n* Styling:  Consistent styling across notification items, visual hierarchy to indicate importance.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification).\nSecondary Actions:  Navigate to different sections via the bottom navigation.\nScreen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (while fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indicators of which notifications are unread.  Feedback on loading or error states.\n",
