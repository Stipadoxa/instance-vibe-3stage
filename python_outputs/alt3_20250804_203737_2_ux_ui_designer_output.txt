**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical layout container as the root.  Each notification type is presented as a separate list item (`10:10214`) within a vertically scrolling container.  Item spacing is set to 8 pixels for visual breathing room.  The leading icon in each list item will be a descriptive icon representing the notification type (e.g., bell for push, email icon for email), and the switch component will be used as a trailing element for on/off control.  This provides a clear and organized presentation of notification settings.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** Users will scroll through the list of notification types. Tapping on a toggle switch will change the notification setting for the respective type and provide visual feedback immediately. This direct manipulation is simple and intuitive.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:10214` (List item) component over a simple `native-text` container for the notification settings because it provides a more structured and visually appealing way to present each notification. This allows for the inclusion of the icon and switch within the pre-built component structure.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated settings screen or a unified component to combine labels, icons, and toggle switches for settings.  Therefore, I utilized a combination of existing components: the `10:10214` (List item) component to create individual rows for each notification type. The `10:9912` (switch) component handles the toggle function.  This combination provides a clear, organized, and familiar user interface for managing settings, while staying within system constraints.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established through clear visual separation between each notification type (achieved through the list items' spacing), prominent labels, and the easily identifiable toggle switches. The placement of each row provides a logical flow and is easy to follow.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the list items (`10:10214`), the "Leading" variant is set to "Icon" and the "Trailing" variant is set to "Switch". This choice creates the desired UI pattern of having an informative icon and a switch directly next to each label, leading to an intuitive and familiar experience.  The "Show supporting text" variant is set to "True" to provide clearer instructions below each heading.

8. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements were needed; all functionality could be achieved by using a combination of pre-existing components from the design system.
