  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.\nUser Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users require a concise, touch-friendly interface, with a focus on efficient authentication and minimal input.  Limited screen real-estate necessitates prioritization of key information.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media login for faster access, recover forgotten password.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All required fields are present, input fields are appropriately sized for touch interaction, error handling is implemented, and the visual hierarchy prioritizes the primary login button.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), password recovery link.\nContextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, etc.), success message upon successful login, \"Remember me\" checkbox (optional),  Terms & Conditions acceptance footnote.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column layout for fields and buttons, optimizing for vertical space.  Social media buttons positioned below the primary login button.\n* Components:  Input fields for username/email and password, primary button labeled \"Log In,\" social media login buttons (use platform-standard icons), password recovery link styled as a subtle secondary link. Footnote text below all elements.\n* Styling:  Adhere to the visual style of the provided reference image,  using a clean and uncluttered design.  Main button should visually stand out from the rest of the elements.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions:  Social media login.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (during authentication), error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirect to app).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation of input fields, clear error messages with suggestions for correction, visual indication of loading.\n",
