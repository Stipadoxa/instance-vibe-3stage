  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain focused on product display and purchase initiation.\nUser Type: Mobile shoppers browsing product listings.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users expect concise product information, large tap targets, and a streamlined purchase flow.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient use of space.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially view product rating or reviews (if space allows), access more product information (e.g., description).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Image is clearly visible, title is concise, price is prominently displayed, \"Buy\" button is large and easily tappable, all elements are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Product image, product title, product price, \"Buy\" button.\nSupporting: Product rating (stars), short product description (if space allows).\nContextual: Out-of-stock indicator, sale price/discount indicator.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single vertical stack of content (image at top, then title, price, button). Consider image aspect ratio optimization for mobile screens.\n* Components: Product Image (high quality, responsive), Title (concise), Price (clearly formatted), Buy Button (prominent call to action).\n* Styling:  Use a consistent design language with other mobile UI elements.  Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Initiate purchase (\"Buy\" button).\nSecondary Actions:  Potentially view more details (if a separate details page exists, indicated via a small icon or link).\nScreen States: Default (showing product information), Loading (if data is still fetching), Out-of-stock (if applicable).\nFeedback Needs:  Visual feedback for button tap (e.g., change in color or appearance), loading indicator while data is fetching.\n",
