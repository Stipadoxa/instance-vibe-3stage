SECTIONS:
1. logo: CraftMart Logo (would require image asset), tagline: "Your marketplace for handcrafted goods" - provides branding and context.
2. form: email and password input fields, login button, "forgot password" link and "Create Account" link - enables user authentication.
3. links: "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" links - provides legal information.

{
  "Component Inventory Verification": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data",
  "Section Planning": "The login screen follows the 'Login' pattern: logo, form, links.  The logo and tagline provide branding. The form contains the email and password fields necessary for login, along with supporting actions for password recovery and account creation. Finally, links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy provide legally required information.",
  "Layout Decisions": "The layout uses a vertical layout container for the root. The logo and tagline are placed at the top, followed by the form in a vertically stacked layout container to ensure a clear vertical flow. The links section appears at the bottom for easy access. Padding is used at the Level 1 content container to create breathing room around the form.",
  "User Flow Reasoning": "The user flow is straightforward. Users first see the branding (logo and tagline), then they are presented with clear input fields for their email address and password.  A prominent 'Sign In' button is provided as the primary action, with secondary actions for password recovery and account creation.  Finally, legal links are located at the bottom.",
  "Component Choices": "I chose the 'Button' component (id: 10:3907) for the login button over using native-rectangle because it provides a consistent, styled button element. I also used the 'text input' component (id: 10:8492) for email and password fields, instead of native-text and native-rectangle combination, for pre-built validation and styling.",
  "Component Gaps": "The user request requires a logo, which is not explicitly a component but rather an image asset to be referenced. I handled this using a 'native-rectangle' element with an image fill. This allows for the flexibility to use any image asset as the logo while adhering to API design constraint.",
  "Visual Hierarchy": "Visual hierarchy is established through size, placement, and color. The logo and tagline are large and prominently placed at the top, followed by the form's key elements (input fields and login button). The secondary links appear smaller at the bottom.  The primary 'Sign In' button is emphasized with color (Primary/primary50: #00b53f).",
  "Variant Selection Rationale": "For the 'Button' component (id: 10:3907), I chose the 'Filled' type and 'Large' size variants for the 'Sign In' button to provide a clear and prominent call to action.  For the input fields (id: 10:8492), I chose the 'Filled' type and 'enabled' state as defaults.",
  "Native Element Justification": "The user request demands a logo, which the Design System does not provide as a component. The use of 'native-rectangle' with image fill effectively fulfills this need while maintaining API compliance."
