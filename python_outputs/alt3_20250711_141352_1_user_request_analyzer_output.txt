Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with user profile management and notification settings.
User Type: Mobile users managing their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise settings page with clear, tappable controls due to limited screen real estate and touch-only interaction.  They may be interrupted easily, so the design should be simple and intuitive.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify user profile information, manage notification preferences, log out of the application.
Secondary Goals:  Easily locate settings options, understand notification settings' impact.
User Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if:  All primary actions (profile editing, notification toggling, logout) are clearly visible and easily accessible with appropriate tap targets; clear visual hierarchy and grouping of settings is present.

Content Requirements
Critical: User profile section (name, potentially profile picture, email address), notifications toggle (with clear on/off indication), logout button.
Supporting:  Links to help/support, version information (optional).
Contextual:  Success/failure messages after profile updates or logout.

Structural & Component Directives

* Layout:  Vertical scrolling list of settings.  Consider grouping related settings together visually.
* Components:  Profile section (potentially using a card component), toggle switch for notifications, button for logout.
* Styling:  Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application's mobile interface.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Edit user profile, toggle notifications, log out.
Secondary Actions: Access help/support (if included).
Screen States: Default state, loading state (if profile updates are asynchronous), success/failure states after actions.
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback on notification toggle state (on/off); success/failure messages after profile updates or logout; loading indicators if actions are asynchronous.
