Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily scannable list, with clear visual hierarchy due to screen size limitations.  Touch interaction is primary.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read, potentially take action based on notification content (e.g., navigate to a related screen).
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch input, potential interruptions while viewing notifications.
Ready for handoff if:  All five notification items are clearly visible and distinguishable, user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are present for each, top bar and bottom navigation are present and functional, and visual hierarchy is clear.


Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications). User information in top bar.
Supporting:  Notification read/unread status indicator.
Contextual:  Empty state message if no notifications are present.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Vertical list for notifications. Top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.
* Components: Top bar containing user information (potentially profile picture and name). Notification item component: User avatar (circular image), title (text, bold), description (text), timestamp (text, smaller font size). Bottom navigation bar with multiple tabs (number and content unspecified).
* Styling:  Visual style not specified, but should align with overall app design language.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification item).
Secondary Actions: Mark notifications as read (potentially implicit via tap).  Navigation via bottom navigation bar.
Screen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), empty state (no notifications).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indicator for read/unread status.  Loading indicator if fetching notifications.
