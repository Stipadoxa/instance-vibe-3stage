Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their accounts via the app
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick and secure access with a touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, gain access to the mobile application
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options, recover forgotten credentials
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential interruptions, varying network conditions

Ready for handoff if:  Primary login button is clearly the most prominent element, all fields are appropriately sized for touch interaction, error messages are clearly displayed, password recovery link is easily accessible, and the T&C footnote is visible and legally compliant.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button
Supporting: Social media login buttons (specify platforms), password recovery link
Contextual: Error messages (for incorrect credentials, etc.), loading indicator during authentication

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Likely a single-column layout due to mobile constraints.  Consider vertical stacking of elements.
* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button ("Login" or similar), multiple secondary buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), a hyperlink for password recovery, a footnote regarding T&C acceptance.
* Styling:  The specific styling is not defined in the request and should be determined through UX/UI design considerations.  However, accessibility guidelines (e.g., sufficient color contrast) must be adhered to.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials
Secondary Actions: Login via social media, recover password
Screen States: Default state (fields visible), loading state (indicator showing authentication in progress), error state (showing specific error messages), success state (transition to app's main screen)
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email/username format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicator during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).
