  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout is structured vertically to accommodate the list of notifications, with the app bar at the top and bottom navigation at the bottom. This approach prioritizes a clear and concise presentation of information within the limited screen real estate of a mobile application.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The primary user flow is viewing a list of notifications.  Tapping a notification item will (in a future iteration) lead to a detailed view of that specific notification. Bottom navigation provides access to other application sections.",
    "componentChoices": "I chose the \"appbar\" (id: 10:5620) component for the top bar, the \"list-item\" (id: 10:10214) component for each notification item, and the \"Bottom navigation\" (id: 10:4724) component for the bottom navigation.  I selected these components over alternatives like \"snackbar\" (id: 10:3856) for the top bar (because snackbars are for transient messages, not persistent UI elements like a header) and  \"card\" (id: 147:3743) for the notification items (cards are generally used for more self-contained units of content), and \"tabs\" (id: 10:7852) for bottom navigation (because tabs imply switching between distinct views within the same domain and bottom nav is for top-level navigation). The selected components are suitable for their respective content and interaction patterns.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Visual hierarchy is established through the use of clear visual distinctions between the UI elements.  The app bar is positioned at the top with larger text sizes and a consistent background color, immediately conveying its importance. Notification items follow, with consistent styling and ample spacing, and bottom navigation is placed at the very bottom.",
    "variantSelectionRationale": "For the appbar, I chose \"Mode\": \"Light\" because it provides better contrast and visibility. For the list-item, I selected \"Condition\": \"2-line\", \"Leading\": \"Image\", \"Trailing\": \"None\", \"Show overline\": \"False\", and \"Show supporting text\": \"True\".  These variants allow for display of the user avatar and notification description in multiple lines as needed. The absence of \"Trailing\" elements and \"Overline\" maintain a streamlined design.  I rejected using \"Leading\": \"Icon\"  because the user avatar serves a similar visual purpose.  The supporting text displays the notification timestamp."
