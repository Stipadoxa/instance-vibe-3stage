  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Settings management within a mobile application (potentially related to an auction or automotive marketplace given the reference image).\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings, preferences, and personal information.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive settings page optimized for touch interaction with limited screen real estate.  Navigation must be clear, and actions must have sufficient tap targets.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Modify account settings, manage preferences, access account information.\nSecondary Goals:  Understand the meaning of less obvious settings, easily find specific settings, log out securely.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile devices, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during use.\nReady for handoff if: All settings listed in the reference image are included and accessible, navigation is clear and consistent with the app's design system, and touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (with ability to modify), Business details (with ability to modify), Access to Cars45 auction (toggle), \"Verified ID\" badge (with explanation), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats (toggle), Disable Feedback (toggle), Manage notifications, Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  Clear visual indicators for toggles (on/off states).\nContextual:  \"What is it?\" explanations for less clear settings (e.g., \"Verified ID\" badge), potential for confirmation dialogs before deleting the account.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical list of settings options.  Each setting is a row in the list.\n* Components:  Use existing app components for list items, toggles, and navigation.  Each setting row should have clear labeling and appropriate UI element (text field, toggle, etc.) based on functionality.\n* Styling:  Adhere to the existing app's color palette and typography.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Selecting and modifying a setting (e.g., tapping on a setting to edit it or toggling a switch).\nSecondary Actions: Accessing help or informational content.\nScreen States: Default state (all settings are visible), Loading state (if settings are being saved), Error state (if an error occurs during saving).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on changes to settings, error messages if applicable, loading indicator.\n",
