  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure.  The top section contains the search bar and filter button. The main content area is a horizontally wrapped layout container to display product cards in a grid. Consistent spacing (16px padding, 8px between items) is used for visual clarity and a clean feel.  Full-width elements utilize `\"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"` for optimal responsiveness.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user starts by using the search bar at the top of the page. They can refine their search using the filter button. The product cards are displayed in a grid, allowing for easy browsing and selection.  Tapping on a product card will lead to a detailed product page (not included in this specification).\n\n4. **Component Choices:**\n    - **SearchBar:** I chose `10:12086` (search-field) because it's a dedicated component for search functionality and aligns perfectly with the design system's conventions. Alternatives such as creating a custom search bar with native elements were considered, but this approach simplifies development and ensures design system consistency.\n\n    - **Filter Button:** I chose `10:3907` (Button) with `variants: { \"Type\": \"Text\", \"Size\": \"Medium\", \"State\": \"Default\", \"Color\": \"Green\"}` because it provides a clear call to action. Other button types (filled, outlined) were considered, but a text button is less visually intrusive in this context.\n\n    - **Product Card:** I chose `147:3743` (product card) as it's purpose-built for displaying product information. Alternatives like constructing a custom card with native rectangles and text elements were less efficient and less consistent with the provided design system.\n\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated rating component (`native-rating` is forbidden). To display seller ratings, I used multiple instances of `635:4752` (icon/star) component with the \"full\" variant to represent a star rating. This approach allows for a visual representation of rating while working within the component constraints.  The design system also lacks a component for a grid layout but provides auto-layout containers, allowing for horizontal wrapping and the flexible grid layout that fits the requirements.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  The search bar and filter button have higher prominence due to their placement at the top of the screen and are larger than the product cards. The product cards are visually grouped using the wrapped layout container.  Typography styles use primary and secondary levels from the design system to distinguish titles from descriptions.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  Variants for the button and other components were chosen based on their appropriate styles and states for the given context.   For example, the `State: \"Default\"` ensures the button shows its default appearance; other states (`Hover`, `Pressed`) are not needed in this static representation.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:**  No native elements were needed for this design beyond `native-rectangle` for image placeholders within the product card. This was used in lieu of a dedicated image component as the design system does not provide a direct replacement and is the only native option that allows this functionality.\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Product Listing Page\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 16, \"paddingBottom\": 16, \"paddingLeft\": 16, \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\", \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:12086\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Device\": \"Mobile\",\n              \"State\": \"default\"\n            },\n            \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n              \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n              \"Type\": \"Text\",\n              \"State\": \"Default\",\n              \"Color\": \"Green\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"layoutWrap\": \"WRAP\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 8,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            },\n            \"width\": 170\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            },\n            \"width\": 170\n          }\n          // ... more product cards as needed ...\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
