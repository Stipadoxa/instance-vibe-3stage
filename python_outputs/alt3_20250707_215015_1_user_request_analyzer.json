  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface; limited screen real estate necessitates efficient design.  The yellow background needs to be considered for accessibility and visual appeal.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable within the design system)\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential accessibility issues with yellow background.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link (if included) is clearly visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, color contrast meets accessibility guidelines.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area\nSupporting: Password recovery link (if included per design system),  \"Remember me\" option (if included per design system)\nContextual: Loading indicator during authentication,  error messages for invalid credentials, success confirmation\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:**  Single-column form layout optimized for mobile.\n*   **Components:**  Text input fields for username/email and password;  button for login;  link for password recovery (if included per design system);  potentially a \"remember me\" checkbox (if included per design system).  Error message display area below form fields.\n*   **Styling:** Background color: Yellow (specific shade defined by design system);  all other colors and styles defined by design system.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery (if applicable)\nSecondary Actions:  None specified, but could include \"create account\" link depending on design system.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state, success state.\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.\n",
