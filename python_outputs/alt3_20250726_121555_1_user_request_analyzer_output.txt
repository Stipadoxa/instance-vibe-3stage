Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control and social login integration
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick and secure access with a touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of content.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account
Secondary Goals: Access account using social media credentials, recover forgotten credentials
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions
Ready for handoff if: Login button is clearly the primary action, all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets, error messages are displayed clearly, and the layout is responsive to different screen sizes.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, error message area
Supporting: Forgot password link, Facebook and Instagram login buttons, terms of service acceptance checkbox
Contextual:  Success/failure messages upon login attempt, loading indicator during authentication

Structural & Component Directives

* Components:  Welcome message (placed at the top), username field (with label), password field (with label and secure input indicator), login button (prominently displayed), Facebook and Instagram login buttons (visually distinct), forgot password link (clearly labeled and easily accessible), terms acceptance checkbox (at the bottom with clear label).
* Styling:  Appropriate use of whitespace and padding for mobile readability, clear visual hierarchy to guide user flow, use of standard mobile design patterns for input fields and buttons.


Screen Requirements

Secondary Actions: Forgot password, agree to terms
Screen States: Default (initial screen display), loading (while authenticating), error (invalid credentials or other issues), success (successful authentication redirecting to the next screen)
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (visual indicators), clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, success message upon successful login.
