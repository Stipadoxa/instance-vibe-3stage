I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below are verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure.  The search bar and filter button occupy the app bar at the top. The product cards are arranged in a grid layout (achieved using a `native-grid` for flexibility and responsiveness, as there isn't a dedicated grid component in the system).  Spacing between grid items and padding around the grid are set for optimal visual clarity.  The `horizontalSizing` property is not directly applicable to the grid itself, but is used within the product card component for full-width image display.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user can initiate a search via the search bar. The filter button allows users to refine their search.  Products are displayed in a grid, which can be easily scanned.  Tapping on a product card navigates to the individual product detail page.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose `10:12086` (search-field) for the search bar because it offers the built-in search functionality and aligns with the app's overall design.  No alternatives were considered because the requirements of the search bar were neatly fulfilled by this component.  I chose `10:3907` (Button) for the filter button due to its clear interactive affordances and the design system's support for customizable variants. There is no other button component available in the system, so no comparison is necessary.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated grid component for arranging product cards.  Therefore, I used a `native-grid` to create the grid layout. This provides the flexibility to manage card arrangement responsively across different screen sizes. This approach works within the existing system by ensuring visual consistency with existing components through styling.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Prominence is established through size, spacing, and color. The search bar is the most prominent.  The filter button is secondary and the product cards are tertiary.  Spacing between sections maintains visual separation.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:12086` (search-field) component, I selected the `default` state to ensure the component renders correctly and is ready for user input.  The `State` variant is set to `default`  because the component should always be initially available for input.  For the `10:3907` button (Filter button), I chose the `Size:Medium` variant for optimal visibility and usability within the app bar context, rather than `Size:Large` or `Size:Small` which may be too large or too small.

8. **Native Element Justification:** The user request necessitates a grid layout to display product cards, a functionality not directly supported by the design system. Thus, a `native-grid` provides a flexible and responsive layout solution for product presentation, enabling optimal visual appeal and user experience across varying screen sizes. This is the most suitable workaround, rather than resorting to complicated nested layouts using existing components.
