**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The dashboard homepage uses a vertical layout.  The top section contains three stats cards displayed horizontally with equal width (`horizontalSizing`: `"FILL"` for each card, ensuring they use the available space). These are followed by the activity feed (a vertical list).  At the bottom,  action buttons ("Create New Listing", "View All Messages") are placed horizontally and the bottom navigation is at the very bottom.  Consistent spacing (16dp) is used between major sections and elements for visual clarity and breathability.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The top stats cards provide a quick overview of key performance indicators, allowing for a quick glance at the seller's progress. The activity feed provides an immediate record of recent actions, providing context and engagement. Action buttons offer direct access to create new listings or manage messages, thus streamlining important tasks. The bottom navigation ensures easy access to other sections of the app.

4. **Component Choices:**  For the stats cards, I've used `native-rectangle` components with image fills as placeholders to allow for future flexibility and consistent appearance.  I opted against using a dedicated "Stats Card" component (if one existed) to better tailor the visual style and spacing for the dashboard's context.  For the buttons, the `10:3907` ("Button") component is used due to its flexibility (supports different sizes, colors, and states). The bottom navigation uses component `10:4724` ("Bottom navigation") as it's specifically designed for this purpose.  I haven't found any system components to replicate a "recent activity feed". Therefore, a workaround will be implemented using native elements.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "Activity Feed" component.  This functionality is crucial to provide real-time updates to the seller. I have implemented a workaround using `native-list-item` components (repeated multiple times in the specification) for each activity.  Each activity item includes `native-text` for title and description and optionally, an `avatar` component (depending on the type of activity) to clearly represent the data. This approach allows for a clean, consistent look while filling the functional gap.


6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  Prominence is established through size and position. The stats cards are larger and positioned at the top to grab immediate attention. The activity feed follows with moderate size and clear visual separation. Action buttons are clearly separated, easily noticeable, and clearly separated from other elements.  The bottom navigation is consistent in size and design.


7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the buttons, I've chosen `"Size": "Medium"`, `"Type": "Filled"`, and `"Color": "Green"` variants because this delivers the best combination of visibility and clear call-to-action design. The `"State": "Default"` variant is used for the basic state. Other variants like "Disabled" or "Pressed" will be handled dynamically.


8. **Native Element Justification:**  As mentioned before, the "Activity Feed" is implemented using `native-list-item` components combined with `native-text` and optionally `10:7773` ("avatar / big") components to handle the diverse data. This native approach allows full control over the visual elements in order to better represent the data.  Using native elements here provides flexibility and customization while maintaining a consistent design language.
