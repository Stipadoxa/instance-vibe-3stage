  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information display; touch interaction is primary; interruptions are common; location awareness is not directly relevant.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications; understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals: Potentially mark notifications as read; potentially interact with notifications directly (e.g., open related content).\nUser Constraints: Small screen size restricts content display; reliance on touch interaction; potential interruptions during notification review.\nReady for handoff if:  All five notification items are clearly visible and legible, user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are present for each notification, top bar and bottom navigation are implemented without overlap or obscuring content.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, and timestamp for each of the five notifications.\nSupporting:  Indicator of unread notifications (if applicable).\nContextual:  Potential for additional content based on notification type (e.g., a button to mark as read).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical list of 5 notification items; top bar at the top; bottom navigation at the bottom.\n*   **Components:** Top bar containing user info (e.g., profile picture, name); Notification item: displays user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; Bottom navigation bar (with undefined number of tabs).\n*   **Styling:**  (Unspecified, requires further design decisions).\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details.\nSecondary Actions: Mark as read (potential); interact with notification content (potential).\nScreen States:  Default state (showing notification list); Potentially a \"No Notifications\" state.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of read/unread status (if applicable).\n\n",
