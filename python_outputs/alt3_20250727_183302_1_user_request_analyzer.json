  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and information via notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need concise notifications due to screen size limitations.  Touch interaction is primary, and interruptions are common.  The design must be easily scannable and actionable.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read, access detailed information related to each notification (depending on the notification type).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with avatar, title, description, and timestamp. Top bar displays user info and bottom navigation is present and functional.  All UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications.  User information in the top bar.  Bottom navigation items (labels should be specified).\nSupporting:  A visual indicator (e.g., a checkmark or different color) to show which notifications have been read.\nContextual:  Loading indicator if notifications are being fetched; an \"empty state\" message if no notifications exist; potentially a \"mark all as read\" option.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications; top bar at the top of the screen; bottom navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.\n* Components: Top bar (user info, perhaps profile icon), Notification list (repeating notification item component x5), Bottom navigation bar (5 tabs).\n* Styling:  Specific styling guidelines for notification item (sizes, fonts, colors, padding) need to be provided.  The same for the top bar and bottom navigation bar.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (tapping a notification item).\nSecondary Actions: Mark a notification as read (either individually or with a bulk action).  Navigate to other app sections via bottom navigation.\nScreen States: Default (showing notifications), loading state (fetching notifications), empty state (no notifications), potentially an error state.\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback when a notification is tapped to show that it's selected or opened.  Loading indicators during fetch.  Appropriate feedback for \"mark as read\" actions.\n",
