  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain within a mobile marketplace app context.\nUser Type: Mobile app users searching for products and filtering results.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, visually clear presentation of search results with easy-to-use filtering mechanisms due to limited screen real estate and touch interaction.  They may be browsing in various environments and have varying levels of patience.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View relevant search results, refine search results using filters.\nSecondary Goals: Sort results by relevance, price, or other criteria; view product details quickly; navigate to product pages seamlessly.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space; touch-based interaction; potential for slow network connections impacting loading times; users may have varying levels of digital literacy.\nReady for handoff if: Filter chips are clearly labeled and interactive; search results are paginated or infinitely scrolling with clear loading indicators; each result displays key information (image, title, price);  navigation to product detail pages is intuitive and immediate.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Search results (product image, title, price); filter chips (categories, price range, etc.); pagination/infinite scroll indicator.\nSupporting: Sort options (e.g., relevance, price, newest); total number of results;  clear indication of applied filters.\nContextual: Loading indicators; \"No results found\" message; error messages (e.g., network issues).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:**  Vertical list of product cards, filter chips positioned at the top of the screen.\n*   **Components:** Product Cards (image, title, price, possibly rating); Filter chips (interactive, with clear labels and potentially counts of products in each filter category); Pagination/infinite scroll mechanism.\n*   **Styling:** Consistent with overall app design language, clear visual hierarchy of search results (most important information presented first).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Tap on product card to view details; apply/remove filter chips.\nSecondary Actions: Sort results; change pagination/view more results.\nScreen States: Initial search results; filtered results; loading state; \"no results\" state; error state.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on filter chip selection (e.g., color change); loading indicators while fetching data; clear error messages explaining why search failed.\n",
