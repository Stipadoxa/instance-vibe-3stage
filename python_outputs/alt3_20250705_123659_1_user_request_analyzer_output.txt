Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain focused on product discovery
User Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products across different categories.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined interface with clear navigation, large touch targets, and quick access to search functionality.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Search for products using keywords, browse products across different categories ("electronics", "home goods", "vehicles").
Secondary Goals: Easily switch between product categories, potentially refine search results (though not specified in request).
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions while browsing, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Search bar is functional and readily visible within the app bar, tabs are clearly labeled, easily tappable, and scrollable if necessary, and the product display area is responsive to different screen sizes.

Content Requirements
Critical: Search bar within the app bar, scrollable tabs labeled "electronics", "home goods", and "vehicles". Placeholder for product display area (implementation not detailed in the request).
Supporting:  Potential for a "loading" indicator while categories load.  Filter/sort options (unspecified in request, but common in e-commerce).
Contextual:  Error messages (e.g., network error during category loading, no results found for search), potentially a "no results" message.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: App bar with search bar, tab layout with scrollable tabs below the app bar.  Product display area below the tabs (layout details for the product display area are not specified).
* Components: App bar (containing the search bar), scrollable tabs with labels "electronics", "home goods", "vehicles".
* Styling: Styling is not specified in the request.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Perform a search, select a product category.
Secondary Actions: None explicitly specified, but common secondary actions in e-commerce apps (like filtering, sorting) could be considered.
Screen States: Default state (tabs visible, search bar ready), loading state (while fetching categories or search results), "no results" state (if search yields no matches).
Feedback Needs:  Visual cues when a tab is selected, potential loading indicators, informative messages for errors or "no results".
