  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile app users attempting to access their accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, touch-friendly interface for authentication, dealing with potential distractions and varying network conditions.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of content.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for convenient access; recover forgotten passwords.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions, need for clear and concise information presentation.\nReady for handoff if:  All interactive elements (fields, buttons, links) have sufficient tap targets for mobile use; error messages are clearly displayed; password recovery and T&C acceptance are easily accessible.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (specify platforms), password recovery link.\nContextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, network issues), success message (upon successful login).  Footnote regarding T&C acceptance upon login.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical layout with fields above the primary button, followed by social login buttons, and finally the password recovery link and T&C footnote.\n* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button (\"Login\" or similar), multiple secondary buttons (social media logins - specify which), hyperlink for password recovery, and a text footnote regarding T&C acceptance.\n* Styling:  Consider mobile-friendly typography and spacing; ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.  Style should be consistent with the overall mobile app design language.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Login via social media accounts.\nScreen States: Default state (login form displayed), loading state (during authentication), error state (invalid credentials, network error), success state (redirect to app content).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email/username format; clear and concise error messages; loading indicator during authentication; visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., redirect).\n",
