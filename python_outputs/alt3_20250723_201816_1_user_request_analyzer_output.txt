Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in to their accounts.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined, touch-friendly login experience with minimal input and clear visual cues.  Screen real estate is limited, and users may be in distracting environments.

User Requirements
Primary Goals:  Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login for faster access; recover lost or forgotten passwords.
User Constraints: Limited screen size on mobile devices; reliance on touch input; potential for interruptions; users might have varying levels of technical proficiency.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) have appropriate tap targets for mobile; error states are clearly indicated;  all required content is present and legible.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field; password field; primary login button; password recovery link; terms and conditions footnote.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google).
Contextual: Error messages for incorrect credentials; loading indicator during authentication.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout to optimize vertical space.
* Components:  Username/email field (text input), password field (secure text input), primary "Login" button (prominent styling), secondary social media login buttons, "Forgot Password?" link (underlined or styled as a link),  Terms and Conditions footnote (small text at the bottom).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Login with social media accounts.
Screen States: Default (initial login screen), loading (during authentication), error (incorrect credentials), success (redirects to app).
Feedback Needs:  Real-time validation of email format (if applicable); clear error messages for invalid inputs; loading indicator during authentication.
