  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile app access\nUser Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a simple, secure, and touch-friendly login experience.  Screen real estate is limited, and users may be in distracting environments.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Securely authenticate and access the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media logins for faster access, recover forgotten passwords.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) have appropriately sized touch targets, error messages are clearly displayed, and the password recovery flow is functional.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, password recovery link.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google),  Terms & Conditions footnote.\nContextual: Error messages (incorrect credentials, network issues), loading indicators.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single-column layout for fields, buttons, and links.  Social media buttons should be grouped.\n* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button (\"Log In\"), multiple social login buttons, a link for \"Password Recovery\", and a footnote for T&C acceptance.\n* Styling: (To be determined based on provided visual reference.  Referencing the example image, a clean and simple layout with clear visual hierarchy is suggested.)\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Log in with credentials, initiate password recovery\nSecondary Actions: Log in via social media\nScreen States: Default, loading, error (incorrect credentials, network), success (redirect to app home).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation of email/username format, clear error messages for invalid inputs, loading indicators during authentication.\n",
