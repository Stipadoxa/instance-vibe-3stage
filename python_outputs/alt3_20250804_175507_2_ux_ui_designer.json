  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The user profile page uses a vertical layout.  The profile picture is displayed at the top, followed by a vertical stack of input fields for name, email, and address.  Each input field is given sufficient spacing for readability.  The `itemSpacing` in the root container is set to 0, and padding is 0 to allow the content sections to control their padding independently and achieve the desired edge-to-edge display.  The `horizontalSizing` property is used where applicable (e.g., for full-width images and text blocks) to ensure that elements appropriately fill the available width.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward. The user sees their current profile information. They can tap/click on each field to edit it.  After making changes, they should be able to save their updates. Error messages will provide immediate feedback for invalid data.\n\n4. **Component Choices:**  \n    * **Avatar:** I chose the `10:7773` (avatar / big) component for the profile picture because it supports image fills and is visually suitable for a profile picture. I considered `10:7798` (avatar / single) and `24:10352` (avatar / stack), but they were either too small or lacked the flexibility for image upload/updates.  \n    * **Input Fields:** I chose the `10:8492` (text input) component for name, email, and address fields as it's a standard input for this purpose. Although there's a `10:8619` (text area) available it's unsuitable for single-line text fields. There is no other apparent text input alternative.\n    * **Buttons:** I chose `10:3907` (Button) for the \"Save\" button due to its standard design and clear call-to-action nature.  \n\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for a complete user profile editing form. To address this, I combined the `10:7773` avatar component, multiple instances of `10:8492` text input components, and `10:3907` button components to create the complete profile editing functionality. The combination of these components offers a user-friendly and consistent experience that meets the user's needs.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The profile picture has the highest visual prominence due to its size and position at the top of the screen.  The name field follows in importance as the primary identifier, with email and address beneath.  The \"Save\" button is clearly distinguished as a call-to-action element.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:7773` avatar component, I selected the `\"Photo\": \"Yes\"` variant because the user should be able to upload and display a profile photo. For the button, I used the \"Medium\" size variant and chose  \"Filled\", \"Default\", \"Green\" color as it's visually appealing and fits in the design context.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements were needed to solve functional gaps, as existing components could be combined to meet the requirements.\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"User Profile Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 16, \"paddingBottom\": 16, \"paddingLeft\": 16, \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\", \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:7773\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Photo\": \"Yes\"\n        },\n        \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:8492\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"enabled\"\n        },\n        \"textLayers\": {\n          \"label-text\": \"Name\"\n        },\n        \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:8492\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"enabled\"\n        },\n        \"textLayers\": {\n          \"label-text\": \"Email\"\n        },\n        \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:8492\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"enabled\"\n        },\n        \"textLayers\": {\n          \"label-text\": \"Address\"\n        },\n        \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n          \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"Default\",\n          \"Color\": \"Green\"\n        },\n        \"textLayers\": {\n          \"Action\": \"Save\"\n        },\n        \"horizontalSizing\": \"STRETCH\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
