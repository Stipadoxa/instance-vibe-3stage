I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been manually verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical `layoutContainer` as the root, providing a top-to-bottom flow for the notification settings. Each notification setting is represented as an item within a `layoutContainer` with horizontal layout to place the label and toggle switch side-by-side.  A small 8px margin is added between each notification setting for visual separation.  The `counterAxisSizingMode` is set to `"AUTO"` for all containers to ensure they automatically adjust to their content size.  There is no padding on the root layout to maximize available space.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** Users can easily scan the list of notification types and use the toggle switches to quickly enable or disable each notification category. The clear labels provide context for each toggle, facilitating straightforward management of preferences.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:9912` (switch) component for toggles because it directly addresses the user's need for on/off switches in a familiar and readily understood manner.  Alternatives like custom checkbox implementations would not provide the immediate visual feedback and simplicity of the dedicated switch component.  The switch component is also visually consistent with the provided design system which ensures a unified user experience.  There is no other component in the system that performs the same function as a toggle switch.

5. **Component Gaps:** The user request requires a list to display the notification settings. While the `10:10214` (List item) component is close, it's designed for more complex list items potentially including leading and trailing icons and supporting text. Using this component for a simple toggle list would be an overkill and introduce unnecessary visual complexity. I created a workaround using a vertical `layoutContainer` to house the `10:9912` switch components paired with `native-text` elements. This streamlined approach fulfills the core requirements of the notification settings screen by keeping it clear, concise, and efficient.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through consistent spacing and the use of clear labels for each notification type. The toggle switches are positioned directly next to the labels, creating a clear visual connection between the label and its corresponding control.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:9912` (switch) component, the `"State": "enabled"` variant is used to ensure the switches are interactive. The `"Selected": ["false", "true"]` variants are used to represent the on and off states, enabling users to easily change their notification settings.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  Since no list component directly supports simple toggle switches and labels,  `native-text` elements were used alongside the `10:9912` (switch) components for the labels. This ensures a clear and simple visual hierarchy while addressing the functional requirement in the absence of a dedicated, simpler list component suitable for this use case.
