  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials (link to password reset),  use convenient login options (consider adding later).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, all fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction,  placeholder text is clear and concise, error messages have designated space and are clearly visible.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Heading (e.g., \"Login\"), email field (with appropriate label), password field (with appropriate label), submit button (labeled \"Login\" or similar).\nSupporting: Password recovery link (text or icon), potentially a \"Remember me\" checkbox (depending on security considerations).\nContextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single-column layout optimized for mobile.\n* Components: Heading (H1 or H2), Email input field, Password input field (secure input type), Submit button.\n* Styling:  Consider using clear visual hierarchy and ample spacing between elements for mobile usability.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Submit login credentials.\nSecondary Actions: Initiate password recovery.\nScreen States: Default (form displayed), Loading (indicator shown during authentication), Error (error message displayed).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format (if possible), clear error messages for login failures, loading indicator during authentication.\n",
