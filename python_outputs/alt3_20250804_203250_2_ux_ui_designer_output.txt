I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical `layoutContainer` to arrange the notification settings in a clear, linear fashion. Each notification setting is presented as a `list-item` component, providing a consistent visual structure and clear separation between settings.  Item spacing is set to 8 for visual breathing room.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user can easily toggle each notification type on or off using the `switch` component.  The clear labels and concise descriptions ensure understanding.  There's no explicit "save" button because it's assumed changes are saved automatically (a common pattern in setting pages).

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `list-item` component to present each notification setting because it provides a structured format for displaying labels and interactive elements (the `switch` component) together. This structure is clear and efficient to use within the settings context. I considered using a `text-input` or a `checkbox` to manage the preferences; however, the `switch` is more intuitive and visually consistent with on/off toggles and preferred for this setting.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "Notification Settings" component that would encapsulate the list of notification types with toggles and descriptions.  Therefore, I used a combination of the `layoutContainer` to structure the list and `list-item` components to represent each individual setting, supplemented with `native-text` elements for custom typography needs. This approach provides a flexible solution that meets the user requirements without creating custom components.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Prominence is established by the visual grouping of `list-item` components, creating a clear visual hierarchy of settings. Text size variation (using `native-text` for headlines and descriptions) guides the user's attention to relevant information.


7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `switch` components, I chose the `State: enabled` variant for all switches to allow for interaction.  The `Selected` variant will dynamically change based on the user's action. The default will be "false" representing initially toggled off state.

8. **Native Element Justification:** Native text elements (`native-text`) are used to provide specific text styles (font size, font weight, and color) to create visual hierarchy beyond what is possible with the available design system's text styles. The `native-text` provides flexibility for a more detailed description of the notification options.
