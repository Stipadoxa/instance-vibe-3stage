  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily scannable list,  with clear visual hierarchy due to screen size limitations.  Touch interactions are primary, and interruptions are common.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Quickly assess notification importance, easily navigate to relevant content within the app based on the notification.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Five notification items are displayed correctly, with consistent layout and spacing;  user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are clearly visible for each; top bar and bottom navigation are present and functional;  visual hierarchy guides users' attention to important information.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications. User information (profile picture or initials, possibly name) in the top bar.\nSupporting:  Number of unread notifications (badge or counter).\nContextual:  Indication of notification read/unread status (e.g., visual cue like bold text or checkmark).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical list of five notification items. Top bar at the top of the screen, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n*   **Components:** Top bar (User Info), Notification Item (Avatar, Title, Description, Timestamp) x5, Bottom Navigation.\n*   **Styling:**  Consistent styling across all notification items. Clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification).\nSecondary Actions:  Navigation to other app screens via bottom navigation.\nScreen States:  Default (showing 5 notifications), Empty state (no notifications), Loading state (fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of loading progress and any errors.  Visual feedback to indicate read/unread status.\n",
