Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), password recovery link.
Contextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials, etc.), success message (upon successful login).  Terms & Conditions footnote.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout to optimize for vertical scrolling on mobile.
* Components:  Input fields (username/email and password), a primary “Login” button styled as a prominent call-to-action, secondary buttons for social media login (e.g., Facebook, Google), a link to password recovery, a footnote regarding acceptance of terms and conditions.
