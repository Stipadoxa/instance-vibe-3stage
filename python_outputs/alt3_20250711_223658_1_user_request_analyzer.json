  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain focused on product display and purchase initiation.\nUser Type: Mobile shoppers browsing product listings.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users require concise product information, large tap targets, and a streamlined purchase flow due to screen size limitations and touch-based interaction.  Users may be interrupted easily.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially view product ratings or reviews (if space allows).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate necessitates concise information display; touch-based interaction requires larger tap targets to avoid accidental presses; users may be distracted and need clear, simple actions.\nReady for handoff if: Image loads quickly, title, price, and buy button are clearly visible and have appropriately sized tap targets, and text is legible at a typical mobile viewing distance.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Product image, product title, product price, \"Buy\" button.\nSupporting:  Could include a short product description (if space allows), potentially a star rating or number of reviews (if space allows).\nContextual:  \"Out of Stock\" message if applicable, loading indicator while image loads.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Single vertical stack for the elements (Image at the top, then title, price, buy button).  Consider a horizontal layout if there are multiple product cards and they must fit across the screen\n* Components: Image component (responsive to screen size), Text component for title and price, Button component for \"Buy.\"\n* Styling:  Consistent with overall app styling; clear visual hierarchy (e.g., title larger than price); use of color to distinguish price, buy button.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Tap \"Buy\" button.\nSecondary Actions:  None (within the card itself; navigation to product detail page would be a separate screen).\nScreen States: Default (showing all content), loading state (image loading), \"Out of Stock\" state.\nFeedback Needs:  Visual feedback on \"Buy\" button tap (e.g., change in color or animation).  Clear visual indicator (e.g., text) if out of stock.\n",
