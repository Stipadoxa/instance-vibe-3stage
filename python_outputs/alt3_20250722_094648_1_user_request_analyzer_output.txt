Secondary Goals: Utilize convenient social login options or password recovery if needed.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if:  All primary and secondary actions are clearly labeled and have appropriately sized tap targets; error states are handled gracefully;  the design is consistent with the provided reference image's visual style and our design system guidelines for spacing, fonts, and color palette.

Supporting: Social login buttons (Google, Apple, Facebook), "or" separator between input field and social logins,  password recovery option (link or button), privacy policy link, terms of service link.
Contextual: Error messages for invalid input, loading indicator during authentication process.
