  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.\nUser Type: Mobile application users attempting to log in.  This includes both new and returning users.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users require a streamlined, touch-friendly interface with clear visual hierarchy and minimal input.  Limited screen real estate necessitates concise design and efficient use of space.  Users may be in distracting environments, requiring a quick and easy authentication process.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Successfully authenticate and access the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for quicker access; recover forgotten passwords; understand terms and conditions.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions, cognitive load minimized for intuitive interaction.\nReady for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) are appropriately sized for touch interaction; all required content is visible and easily understood; error states are clearly displayed; visual hierarchy prioritizes the primary action (login button).\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button, password recovery link.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), Terms & Conditions acceptance footnote.\nContextual: Error messages (incorrect credentials, network issues), loading indicator during authentication, success message upon successful login.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column layout for optimal mobile viewing.  Fields and buttons vertically stacked.\n* Components:  \n    * Username/email field: Single-line text input field.\n    * Password field: Single-line secure text input field (masked input).\n    * Primary Login Button: Prominent button below input fields.\n    * Social Media Login Buttons: Row of buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google) below the primary login button.\n    * Password Recovery Link: Hyperlink below social media buttons.\n    * Terms & Conditions Footnote: Small text at the very bottom of the screen.\n* Styling:  Adhere to the visual style of the provided reference image (light background, clear text, intuitive layout).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login via username/password, login via social media.\nSecondary Actions: Password recovery.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state, error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirect to app).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation of username/email format and password length/complexity; clear, concise error messages; loading indicator during authentication; visual confirmation upon successful login (e.g., screen transition).\n",
