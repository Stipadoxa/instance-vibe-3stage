  "content": "**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout utilizes a vertical layout mode for the overall screen. The appbar is placed at the top, followed by the search bar and filter button, organized horizontally for easy access.  The product grid occupies the remaining screen space using a horizontal layout with `layoutWrap: \"WRAP\"` to accommodate responsive resizing of product cards.  I used consistent 16px padding for internal containers and 8px spacing between product cards in the grid.  Product card images utilize `horizontalSizing: \"FILL\"` to maximize visual impact within their containers.\n\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first encounters the app bar at the top, providing navigation and context.  The prominent search bar allows direct product searching. A filter button enables refined searches.  The product grid presents results in a visually appealing and easy-to-browse layout.  The product cards are designed to be easily scanned for key information (image, title, price, and rating).\n\n4. **Component Choices:**\n    * **Appbar:** I chose the `10:5620` (appbar) component over using only native elements because it provides a pre-built structure including leading and trailing icon areas, improving consistency with the design system.\n    * **Search Bar:** I chose the `10:12086` (search-field) component over using a `native-text` input because it offers a better user experience for search, including placeholder text and visual feedback.\n    * **Filter Button:** I chose the `10:3907` (Button) component for the filter button because it's a standard, accessible component that conveys clear interaction.\n    * **Product Card:** I selected `147:3743` (product card) as it's specifically designed for product listings, offering a standardized structure.  I considered using a `native-rectangle` combined with other native elements, but the `product card` component streamlines development and maintains design system consistency.\n\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated grid layout component optimized for product cards.  To solve this, I leveraged a `native-layoutContainer` with `layoutMode: \"HORIZONTAL\"` and `layoutWrap: \"WRAP\"` to create the grid, along with the `147:3743` (product card) component. This approach provides a flexible and responsive grid that adapts well to different screen sizes and numbers of products.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through size, position, and color. The appbar is the most prominent element at the top. The search bar, being a key interaction element, has good visual emphasis.  The product cards are consistently sized within the grid, creating visual order and clarity.  The price and rating are presented with higher visual weight compared to the other information on the product card through font size.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**\n    * **Appbar (10:5620):** I chose `Mode: \"Light\"`, `Type: \"Default\"`, and `Elevation: \"flat\"` for the appbar, as this configuration best suits a product listing page.\n    * **Button (10:3907):** The filter button uses `Platform: \"Android+Web\"`, `Size: \"Medium\"`, `Type: \"Filled\"`, `State: \"Default\"`, and `Color: \"Green\"` which is the standard styling and best reflects its function.\n    * **Product Card (147:3743):** I selected `view: \"grid\"` and `type: \"normal\"` variants as they are suited for a grid-style product layout.\n\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:**  A grid layout for the product cards was not directly supported by the design system’s components. The use of a `native-layoutContainer` with `layoutMode: \"HORIZONTAL\"` and `layoutWrap: \"WRAP\"` provides the necessary flexibility and responsiveness to create a grid-like layout for the products cards. This solution offers the best balance between achieving the design’s functional requirement and using the provided design system components.\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Product Listing Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 0,\n    \"paddingTop\": 0,\n    \"paddingBottom\": 0,\n    \"paddingLeft\": 0,\n    \"paddingRight\": 0,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:5620\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Mode\": \"Light\",\n          \"Type\": \"Default\",\n          \"Elevation\": \"flat\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"headline\": \"Search Results\",\n          \"subheadline\": \"Electronics\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n        \"paddingTop\": 16,\n        \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n        \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n        \"paddingRight\": 16,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:12086\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Device\": \"Mobile\",\n              \"State\": \"default\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n              \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n              \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n              \"State\": \"Default\",\n              \"Color\": \"Green\"\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"Action\": \"Filter\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"layoutGrow\": 1,\n        \"layoutWrap\": \"WRAP\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 8,\n        \"paddingTop\": 16,\n        \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n        \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n        \"paddingRight\": 16,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"#title\": \"Product Title 1\",\n              \"#price\": \"20.99\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"4.5\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"(100)\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"#title\": \"Product Title 2\",\n              \"#price\": \"50.50\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"4.0\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"(50)\"\n            }\n          }\n          // ... more product cards ...\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
