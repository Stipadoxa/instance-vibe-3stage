I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical layout mode for a clear top-to-bottom flow of information.  Each input field is placed in its own container for visual separation and to allow for potential future expansion (e.g., adding error messaging). The save button is positioned at the bottom for clarity and easy access. Consistent spacing (16px) is used between elements for visual harmony and mobile responsiveness.  All `native-text` elements use the design system's text styles where applicable. `horizontalSizing`: `"FILL"` is used on the `native-text` elements for input fields to ensure they occupy the full available width.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user will complete each field sequentially, from top to bottom.  On successful completion and submission, positive feedback (not implemented in this basic spec) will be provided, possibly using a snackbar component.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:8492` (text input) component for each address field because it provides the basic functionality needed, including placeholder text, and is a standard input field expected in this context. The `10:3907` (Button) component was chosen for its clear visual indication and standard interaction pattern for a save action.  Alternatives considered were  `10:8619` (text area) which is inappropriate for single-line inputs, and using multiple `native-text` components with manual input which sacrifices design system consistency.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated address form component.  Therefore, I used a combination of available components (`10:8492` input fields and `10:3907` button) and native layout elements to structure the form. This approach ensures that the form is fully functional, while staying true to the design system's style and standards.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the vertical layout structure, where the fields appear in a logical order and the save button is prominent at the bottom.  Clear labels are provided for each field.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the input fields (`10:8492`), the `"Type": "Filled"` variant is selected to provide a clear visual boundary. The `"State": "enabled"` variant is selected as it is the default and appropriate state for input fields.  For the save button (`10:3907`), `"Size": "Medium"`, `"Type": "Filled"`, `"State": "Default"`, and `"Color": "Green"` variants were chosen to provide a clear call to action. Other states (hover, pressed) are inherent to the button component.


8. **Native Element Justification:**  A vertical `layoutContainer` is used as a native element to structure the form. This is necessary because the design system doesn't offer a dedicated address form component, and native layout containers are the most efficient and consistent way to create the needed vertical arrangement of fields.
