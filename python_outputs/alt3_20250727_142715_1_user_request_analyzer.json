  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their accounts via the app\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick and secure access with a touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, gain access to the mobile application\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media login options, recover forgotten credentials\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential interruptions, varying network conditions\n\nReady for handoff if:  Primary login button is clearly the most prominent element, all fields are appropriately sized for touch interaction, error messages are clearly displayed, password recovery link is easily accessible, and the T&C footnote is visible and legally compliant.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (specify platforms), password recovery link\nContextual: Error messages (for incorrect credentials, etc.), loading indicator during authentication\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Likely a single-column layout due to mobile constraints.  Consider vertical stacking of elements.\n* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button (\"Login\" or similar), multiple secondary buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), a hyperlink for password recovery, a footnote regarding T&C acceptance.\n* Styling:  The specific styling is not defined in the request and should be determined through UX/UI design considerations.  However, accessibility guidelines (e.g., sufficient color contrast) must be adhered to.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials\nSecondary Actions: Login via social media, recover password\nScreen States: Default state (fields visible), loading state (indicator showing authentication in progress), error state (showing specific error messages), success state (transition to app's main screen)\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email/username format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicator during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., navigation to the next screen).\n",
