**STAGE 1 ANALYSIS:**
This is an e-commerce request for a unclear platform (could be mobile or desktop). The user wants to create a detailed product listing page for a used laptop to facilitate its sale.

**STAGE 2 CORE CONTENT:**

*Screen Purpose*: To provide potential buyers with comprehensive information about a used laptop for sale, enabling them to make an informed purchase decision.

*Primary Content*:
- Heading: "2020 MacBook Pro 13-inch - Space Gray - Excellent Condition"
- Key Information: 
    - Price: $850
    - Condition: Excellent (minor cosmetic scratches on the bottom case)
    - Images: Carousel of at least 5 high-quality images showcasing the laptop from different angles, including the screen, keyboard, ports, and any imperfections.
    - Seller Profile:  Avatar image, username (e.g., "techsavvyseller"), seller rating (4.8 stars, 123 reviews)
- Primary Actions: "Contact Seller", "Add to Cart" (if applicable to the platform)


*Supporting Elements*:
- Secondary Actions: "Report Listing" (if inappropriate content is suspected), "View Seller Profile" (links to the seller's complete profile page), "Save Listing" (to save it for later).
- Status Indicators: "Listed 3 days ago"
- Domain Elements: Specifications table (Processor: Intel Core i5, RAM: 16GB, Storage: 512GB SSD, etc.), Detailed description section (e.g., "Lightly used MacBook Pro in excellent condition.  Includes original charger.  Battery health at 95%.  Upgraded to macOS Ventura."),  Shipping information (if applicable, e.g., "Free shipping within the US").


*Content Examples*:
- Sample Data:  The above examples of heading, price, condition, seller info, specifications, and description
- Microcopy:  "Contact Seller" button tooltip: "Send a message to the seller to ask questions or to negotiate."
- Empty State:  (Not applicable in this case, as it assumes a populated listing)


**STAGE 3 NAVIGATION:**

Since the platform is unspecified, I will assume a web-based platform:

- Header Navigation: Home,  Categories, My Account, Help
- Sidebar Navigation (optional):  Similar Listings, Seller's Other Listings (if available)
- Breadcrumbs:  Electronics > Laptops > MacBook Pro
