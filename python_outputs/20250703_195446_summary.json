      "content": "Product Requirements Document: Secure User Login for ProjectZenith SaaS\n\nDomain Analysis\nPrimary Domain: Business/SaaS  Confidence Level: High (90%+)\nKey Evidence: \"SaaS app\" explicitly states a Software as a Service application, a core element of the Business/SaaS domain.  The request for a login page is a fundamental component of any SaaS application for user authentication and authorization.\nAlternative Domains Considered: None. The context clearly points to a business-oriented software application.\nValidation Check: The user request directly mentions a SaaS application, eliminating ambiguity. The login page is a standard feature universally present in SaaS products, strongly supporting the Business/SaaS classification.\n\n\nUser Profile\nPrimary Users:\n* Project Managers: Individuals responsible for managing projects within the application.  Typically have experience with project management software and prioritize efficiency.\n* Team Members: Individuals contributing to projects, ranging from junior team members to senior specialists. Varying levels of technical proficiency.\n* Administrators: Individuals responsible for managing user accounts, permissions, and overall system settings. Strong technical aptitude.\n\nUsage Context: Users access the application daily from various locations (office, home, remote locations) using a variety of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets).  They may experience interruptions due to meetings or other tasks.  Time constraints may vary depending on the urgency of project tasks.\n\nEnvironment: Primarily desktop and laptop computers, with potential use on tablets.  Access may be from various network locations (office, home Wi-Fi, mobile data). Interruptions and time constraints are expected.\n\nPrimary Goals: Securely access the application to perform their work-related tasks, collaborate with team members, and manage projects.\n\n\nCore Use Cases\n1. **Successful Login:** A Project Manager enters their correct credentials (username/email and password), and the system successfully authenticates them, granting access to the application's dashboard.\n2. **Failed Login (Incorrect Credentials):** A Team Member enters an incorrect username or password. The system displays a clear error message, prompting for re-entry, and potentially enforcing a lockout after multiple failed attempts.\n3. **Password Reset:** A user forgets their password. The system provides a secure mechanism to reset their password via email verification.\n4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** An administrator logs in and is prompted for secondary authentication (e.g., one-time code via authenticator app).\n5. **Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration:** A team member using SSO logs in via their organization's identity provider.\n6. **Login on Mobile Device:** A project manager uses their tablet to access the application securely.\n\n\nFunctional Requirements\n1. **Authentication:** (Priority: Critical)\n    Purpose: Securely verify user identity to protect sensitive data.\n    Core Capabilities: Username/email and password login, password reset functionality, MFA support, SSO integration (future).\n    Data Requirements: Usernames/emails, securely hashed passwords, MFA tokens (if enabled).\n    Integration Needs:  Integration with an identity provider (SSO) - future consideration.  Secure password hashing library.\n\n\n2. **Authorization:** (Priority: Critical)\n    Purpose: Control access to application features based on user roles and permissions.\n    Core Capabilities: Role-based access control (RBAC), limiting access to specific features based on user roles.\n    Data Requirements: User roles, permissions associated with roles.\n    Integration Needs:  Integration with existing user database, if applicable.\n\n\n3. **Session Management:** (Priority: High)\n    Purpose: Maintain secure user sessions to prevent unauthorized access.\n    Core Capabilities:  Automatic logout after inactivity, secure session tokens, IP address logging.\n    Data Requirements: Session IDs, timestamps, IP addresses.\n    Integration Needs:  Session management library.\n\n\n4. **Error Handling:** (Priority: High)\n    Purpose: Provide informative error messages to guide users.\n    Core Capabilities:  Clear error messages for incorrect credentials, password reset failures, account lockouts.\n    Data Requirements: Error codes, user-friendly error messages.\n    Integration Needs: Error logging system.\n\n\nBusiness Requirements\nSuccess Metrics: Successful login rate (percentage of login attempts resulting in successful authentication), reduction in security incidents, user satisfaction with login process.\nPerformance Targets:  Login time < 2 seconds (95th percentile),  password reset process completed within 60 seconds, less than 1% of login attempts resulting in errors.\nCompliance: Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), secure password storage practices (e.g., bcrypt).\n\n\nUser Experience Requirements\nInformation Priority:  Prominent display of username/email field, clear password field instructions (password visibility toggle, minimum length), prominent “Login” button.  Password reset link should be easily accessible.\nInteraction Patterns:  Standard username/password login form, clear visual feedback on input (e.g., error validation), intuitive password reset workflow.\nPlatform Constraints: Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.  Adherence to WCAG accessibility guidelines.\n",
