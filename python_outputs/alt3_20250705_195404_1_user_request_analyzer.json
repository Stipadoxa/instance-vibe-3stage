They may be browsing in various contexts and have limited attention spans.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Find relevant products quickly and easily, refine search results using filters.\nSecondary Goals: Sort results by relevance, price, or other criteria; view product details quickly.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile devices, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Filter chips are clearly visible and interactive, search results are displayed efficiently, loading states are handled gracefully, and prominent visual cues guide users.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Search results (product images, titles, prices), filter chips (categories, price range, etc.), pagination/scrolling mechanism.\nSupporting: Product ratings and reviews (summary), sorting options, number of results found.\nContextual: Loading indicator while fetching results, \"no results found\" message, filter chip states (active/inactive).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical scrolling list of product cards below filter chips; filter chips horizontally arranged at top.\n*   **Components:** Product Cards (image, title, price, rating summary), Filter Chips (with clear labels and states), Pagination or infinite scroll.\n*   **Styling:** Consistent with overall marketplace app branding, clear visual hierarchy for results and filters.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View product details, apply filters, navigate through results.\nSecondary Actions: Sort results, clear filters, view advanced search options.\nScreen States: Default (showing initial results), filtering (showing filtered results), loading (while fetching data), empty (no results).\nFeedback Needs: Visual feedback for filter application, clear loading indicators, error handling for network issues or invalid filters.\n",
