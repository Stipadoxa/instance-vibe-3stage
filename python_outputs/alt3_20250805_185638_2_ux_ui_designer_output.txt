I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been manually verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout employs a vertical structure.  The search bar occupies the full width at the top for immediate visibility. The filter button is placed next to the search bar for easy access. Product cards are arranged in a grid using a horizontally wrapped `layoutContainer`, allowing for responsive adjustment based on screen size.  Consistent 16px padding is used around the grid container and 8px spacing between grid items to ensure readability and visual breathing room.  Product cards use `horizontalSizing: "AUTO"` to allow them to adjust to content size.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow prioritizes quick product discovery. The search bar facilitates immediate searching, while the filter button offers more refined browsing.  The grid layout provides a clear and efficient visual presentation of multiple product cards.  The information within each product card (image, title, price, rating) is presented in a hierarchy supporting quick comprehension.

4. **Component Choices:**
    * **`10:12086` (searchbar):** Chosen over using a native `native-text` input with a search icon because the dedicated searchbar component provides built-in styling and behavior, aligned with the design system.
    * **`10:3907` (button):**  Chosen for the filter button due to its pre-built design and interactive properties. No alternatives were considered as a dedicated button is necessary.
    * **`147:3743` (product card):** This is the most appropriate component for displaying individual products. No close alternatives were found which included image display, text layers for title, price and rating simultaneously.  Native components would require significant extra effort to replicate.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a built-in rating component.  To address this gap, I've implemented a workaround using five instances of the `635:4752` (icon/star) component within each product card. Each star icon's variant is set accordingly (full, half, empty) to represent the rating. This solution leverages the existing star icon, retaining design system consistency.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Prominence is established through size and positioning. The search bar is the largest element at the top.  Product card titles are larger than other text elements.  The rating stars are visually distinct, making the rating instantly noticeable.  The vertical layout guides the user's eye down the page.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**
    * **`10:12086` (searchbar):** The "default" state is used for the initial state, and "filled" would be used dynamically if a user inputs data.
    * **`10:3907` (button):**  The "Medium" size was selected for optimal readability and mobile context.  The "Default" state is used; other states will adjust dynamically based on user interaction.
    * **`147:3743` (product card):** The "grid" view is selected to display items as a grid, rather than a list. The "normal" type is used because it is the default style.

8. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements were necessary due to the design system offering suitable components or workarounds.
