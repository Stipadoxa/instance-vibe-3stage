Domain & Context
Domain: Settings management within a mobile application context (Cars45 auction platform implied).
User Type: Mobile users of the Cars45 auction app needing to manage account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users expect a simple, intuitive interface with clear navigation and touch-friendly elements. Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient information presentation.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify personal information, manage account preferences (notifications, communication settings), and securely log out.
Secondary Goals: Understand account status (e.g., "Verified ID" badge), access help/information (e.g., "What is it?").
User Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All settings options from the reference image are included, navigation is consistent with the app's design system, and touch targets meet accessibility standards.

Content Requirements
Critical: Personal details (name, contact info), business details (if applicable), account settings (notifications, language, chats, feedback), password change, account deletion, logout.  Access to Cars45 auction status. "Verified ID" badge with explanation.
Supporting:  Information links ("What is it?" for relevant settings).
Contextual:  Status indicators (e.g., "Active" for auction access).

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  List-based layout, similar to the reference image, with top and bottom app navigation.  Each setting item should be a row with a label and appropriate action (toggle, detail screen navigation).
* Components:  Use existing app components for list items, toggles, and navigation.  The navigation should consist of a top navigation bar for back button and title and a bottom navigation bar as per app standard.
* Styling: Adhere to the existing app's color palette and styling guidelines.  Maintain visual consistency with other app screens.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Navigate to a detail screen to modify settings, toggle settings on/off, initiate logout.
Secondary Actions: Access help/information links.
Screen States:  Default state, potentially loading state while fetching settings data.
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback for toggled settings (on/off states clearly indicated).  Loading indicators where applicable.
