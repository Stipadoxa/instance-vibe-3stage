  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical `layoutContainer` to arrange the notification settings.  Each notification type is presented as a separate `list-item` component, creating a clear and organized list.  `itemSpacing` is set to 16 for comfortable visual separation between items. Padding is applied within the `list-item` components to create visual breathing room around the text and toggle switches.  The `horizontalSizing` property isn't explicitly needed for the `list-item` component as it will respect the width of its parent container.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user can easily scan the list of notification types, understand each type's function through clear descriptive text, and directly toggle the on/off state using the built-in switch. This straightforward flow minimizes cognitive load and enhances usability.\n\n4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:10214` (\"List item\") component for displaying each notification setting because it provides a structured layout for the text and toggle switch combination.  The inclusion of \"Leading\" and \"Trailing\" variants allowed me to position an icon (if needed for future expansion) and a toggle switch effectively. I considered using `native-row` with manual spacing, but the `list-item` offers a more visually cohesive approach while maintaining design system consistency.  The `10:9912` (\"switch\") component offers a straightforward way to implement the toggle switches.\n\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated \"Notification Settings\" component. I used a combination of existing components (`10:10214`, `10:9912`, and `native-text`) to achieve the functionality and appearance of the desired Notification Settings page. This approach allows for a consistent user experience that mirrors other settings within the app.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the vertical list arrangement of `list-item` components. The notification type label is presented as primary text, immediately followed by the toggle switch.  This promotes straightforward understanding and interaction for each setting.\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `list-item` component (`10:10214`), the variants are set as follows:  `Condition: \"1-line\"`, `Leading: \"None\"`, `Trailing: \"Switch\"`, `Show overline: \"False\"`, `Show supporting text: \"True\"`. \"1-line\" is selected because the description text will be concise.  `Leading: \"None\"` is selected as we are not using a leading icon in this design. `Trailing: \"Switch\"` places the toggle switch in the trailing position.  `Show overline: \"False\"` and `Show supporting text: \"True\"` are used for a clean presentation of the description text. The selected state for the `switch` component (`10:9912`) will be dynamically controlled based on user preference.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:**  Native `native-text` elements are used to display the notification type labels and descriptions, because while text styles exist, they need to be assigned to specific nodes within the `list-item` structure, to guarantee consistent hierarchy across the screen.\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Notification Settings Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 16, \"paddingBottom\": 16, \"paddingLeft\": 16, \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\", \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"None\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"True\"\n        },\n        \"properties\":{\n          \"Headline\": \"Push Notifications\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive push notifications for important updates.\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"None\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"True\"\n        },\n        \"properties\":{\n          \"Headline\": \"Email Alerts\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive email alerts for important updates.\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"None\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"True\"\n        },\n        \"properties\":{\n          \"Headline\": \"SMS Updates\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive SMS updates for important updates.\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"None\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"True\"\n        },\n        \"properties\":{\n          \"Headline\": \"Promotional Offers\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive notifications about promotional offers.\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
