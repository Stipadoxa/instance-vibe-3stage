  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage and view notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily scannable notification list due to screen size limitations.  Touch interaction is primary, and interruptions are likely.  The design should prioritize clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read, potentially dismiss notifications individually or in bulk.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions impacting loading times.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp.  Top bar with user info and bottom navigation are present and functional.  All UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each notification.  User information in top bar.  Navigation items in bottom navigation.\nSupporting:  Notification read status indicator (e.g., visual cue for unread notifications).\nContextual:  \"No notifications\" message when the list is empty, loading indicator while fetching notifications.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Top bar (containing user info, potentially a search icon), Notification Item (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation (containing multiple navigation tabs).\n* Styling:  Consistent styling across all components, appropriate use of spacing and padding to ensure readability and usability on mobile.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping a notification item).\nSecondary Actions: Mark as read (potentially swipe-to-dismiss), potentially clear all notifications.\nScreen States: Default state (showing notifications), loading state (while fetching notifications), empty state (\"No notifications\").\nFeedback Needs:  Visual feedback for read/unread notifications, visual feedback for actions (e.g., animation when dismissing a notification).\n",
