## STAGE 1: UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST

This request belongs to the **E-commerce** domain. The platform context is **unclear**, though a mobile implementation is assumed in Stage 3. The user wants to display a concise representation of a seller's information, likely within a product listing or search results page, to allow users to quickly assess seller trustworthiness and potentially navigate to their store.


## STAGE 2: GENERATE CORE CONTENT

**Main Screen Purpose**: To display seller information within a product listing or marketplace search, enabling users to identify and vet sellers before making a purchase.

**Required Information & Actions**:

* **Heading**:  (None needed; this is a row within a larger interface)
* **Key Information Blocks**:
    * **Avatar Image**: A square, 50x50 pixel profile picture of the seller.  Example:  [Image of a smiling person]
    * **Seller Name**:  The seller's store or business name. Example: "EcoFriendlyGoods"
    * **Seller Rating**: A numerical rating (e.g., 4.8 out of 5 stars) accompanied by the number of ratings in parentheses. Example: "4.8 (1234)"
* **Primary & Secondary Actions**:
    * **Navigation to Seller Profile**:  A tappable area encompassing the entire row leading to the seller's full profile page.  (No explicit button needed, the entire row acts as the CTA).
* **Required Status Indicators**: None explicitly required for this row.


**Content Examples:**

- **Seller with high rating:** [Avatar Image of a person]  "ArtisanCrafts"  4.9 (876)
- **Seller with lower rating:** [Avatar Image of a person] "QuickShipDeals" 3.2 (21)
- **No data:** (If there is a problem retrieving seller data) This area will show only a placeholder indicating the seller's data is currently unavailable


## STAGE 3: ADD NAVIGATION

**Mobile App Navigation:**

This row is assumed to be part of a larger screen (product listing or search results).  Therefore, only the surrounding screen's navigation is relevant.

* **Top Navigation**:  "Back" (Icon: Left-pointing arrow)
* **Bottom Navigation**:  "Home" (Icon: House), "Search" (Icon: Magnifying glass), "Cart" (Icon: Shopping cart), "Profile" (Icon: Person)


Note:  The specific bottom navigation elements will depend on the overall app structure, but these are common in e-commerce apps.  The seller profile row itself doesn't require independent top or bottom navigation.
