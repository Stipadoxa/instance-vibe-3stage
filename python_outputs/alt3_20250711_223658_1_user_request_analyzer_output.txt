Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain focused on product display and purchase initiation.
User Type: Mobile shoppers browsing product listings.
Platform Impact: Mobile users require concise product information, large tap targets, and a streamlined purchase flow due to screen size limitations and touch-based interaction.  Users may be interrupted easily.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially view product ratings or reviews (if space allows).
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate necessitates concise information display; touch-based interaction requires larger tap targets to avoid accidental presses; users may be distracted and need clear, simple actions.
Ready for handoff if: Image loads quickly, title, price, and buy button are clearly visible and have appropriately sized tap targets, and text is legible at a typical mobile viewing distance.

Content Requirements
Critical: Product image, product title, product price, "Buy" button.
Supporting:  Could include a short product description (if space allows), potentially a star rating or number of reviews (if space allows).
Contextual:  "Out of Stock" message if applicable, loading indicator while image loads.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Single vertical stack for the elements (Image at the top, then title, price, buy button).  Consider a horizontal layout if there are multiple product cards and they must fit across the screen
* Components: Image component (responsive to screen size), Text component for title and price, Button component for "Buy."
* Styling:  Consistent with overall app styling; clear visual hierarchy (e.g., title larger than price); use of color to distinguish price, buy button.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Tap "Buy" button.
Secondary Actions:  None (within the card itself; navigation to product detail page would be a separate screen).
Screen States: Default (showing all content), loading state (image loading), "Out of Stock" state.
Feedback Needs:  Visual feedback on "Buy" button tap (e.g., change in color or animation).  Clear visual indicator (e.g., text) if out of stock.
