I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The dashboard homepage uses a vertical layout for the main content, placing quick stats cards at the top, followed by a recent activity feed, and action buttons.  The bottom navigation is consistently positioned at the bottom of the screen.  Consistent 16px spacing is used between major sections to improve readability.  HorizontalSizing is used where needed for full-width elements.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow prioritizes quick access to essential information and actions.  The top section provides key performance indicators, followed by recent activity updates. Prominent buttons encourage further interaction (creating new listings or viewing messages). Bottom navigation ensures easy navigation to other sections within the seller dashboard.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:4724` (Bottom navigation) component because it directly addresses the need for bottom navigation and is natively within the design system.  I didn't consider creating a custom bottom navigation bar since one is readily available within the design system.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design requires visually appealing cards to display quick stats; however, there is no suitable “card” component in the design system that matches our visual needs.  Therefore, I used a `native-rectangle`  with rounded corners and image/color fills to represent the quick stats cards. This solution provides a visually consistent and functionally correct card representation while adhering to native element specifications and not creating any fictional components.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through:
    - Placement: Key metrics (stats cards) are at the top.
    - Size & Color:  Stats cards are larger and bolder than the activity feed.  A primary color scheme is used for emphasis.
    - Typography: Headline styles are used for titles, body styles for descriptions, and smaller caption styles for secondary information.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** Variants were not selected for the `native-rectangle` placeholder since the design system doesn't provide suitable image card components. For the `10:4724` (Bottom navigation) component, the "Mobile" device variant was chosen based on the assumed mobile-first approach.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  As noted above, the lack of a "card" component in the design system necessitated the use of `native-rectangle` elements to create quick stats cards.  This provides a visual structure for data organization, improving the user experience.
