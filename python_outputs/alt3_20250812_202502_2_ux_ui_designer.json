Padding is applied to containers to create breathing room and ensure elements are not cramped. The `Standard Content Container Pattern` is used for most sections to maintain consistency.\n\n**Component Behavior:** The design understands and utilizes the behavior of available components.  For example, the \"Button\" component (componentNodeId: \"10:3907\") is used for primary actions (\"Contact Seller,\" \"Add to Cart\") with the `Size: \"Large\"` and `Type: \"Filled\"` variants to maximize visual impact and tappability.  The lack of a suitable image gallery component necessitates using native image components to display multiple product images.\n\n**Color Application:** The color palette is carefully selected to align with the design system.  The \"Primary/primary50\" (#00b53f) color is used sparingly for key actions (buttons) to highlight them against the predominantly neutral background. \"Neutral/neutral90\" (#304049) and \"Neutral/neutral50\" (#6c8ea0) are used for primary and secondary text respectively, ensuring good contrast and readability. Backgrounds consistently utilize \"White/white100\" (#ffffff).\n\n\n**Layout Strategy:** The layout employs a vertical layout, following a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal usability on smaller screens.  The visual hierarchy and spacing create a natural top-to-bottom reading flow.  The `Standard Content Container Pattern` is frequently used for consistency.  Images are placed prominently at the top, followed by key information, then the detailed description.\n\n\n\n## Domain Context Integration\n\n**Industry Patterns:** The design incorporates common e-commerce patterns, such as prominent product images, clear pricing, concise product information, and prominent call-to-action buttons.  Seller information and ratings help to build trust and credibility.\n\n**User Mental Models:** The layout prioritizes information based on user expectations in an e-commerce context: images first, then key details (price, condition), followed by more detailed specifications and seller information. The placement of primary actions (\"Contact Seller\", \"Add to Cart\") reinforces a clear path to purchase or interaction.\n\n**Contextual Adaptations:** The design system lacks a dedicated \"Product Card\" component; therefore, fallback strategy is used to leverage other elements and build out the visual structure.  The lack of a dedicated image gallery component means using native image elements is necessary.\n\n## Design System Compliance\n\n**Component Verification:** All componentNodeIds are verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n**Variant Completeness:** All necessary variants are specified for chosen components where applicable and values are valid.\n\n**Text Property Mapping:**  Text content is mapped precisely to the appropriate textLayers within chosen components, leveraging textHierarchy.\n\n**Schema Adherence:** Component properties precisely adhere to their respective definitions in the schema and fallback mechanisms are used where necessary.\n\n\n**SECTION 2: DESIGN SPECIFICATION**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n  \"name\": \"Product Detail Page - Mobile\",\n  \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n  \"width\": 375,\n  \"minHeight\": 812,\n  \"backgroundColor\": \"White/white100\",\n  \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"FIXED\",\n  \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"FIXED\",\n  \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n  \"paddingTop\": 16,\n  \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n  \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n  \"paddingRight\": 16,\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n      \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"native-text\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"content\": \"2020 Dell XPS 13 - Used\",\n            \"textStyle\": \"Headline/Large\",\n            \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral90\"\n          },\n          \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\",\n          \"layoutAlign\": \"STRETCH\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n          \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n          \"itemSpacing\": 8,\n          \"items\":[\n            { \"type\": \"native-image\", \"properties\": { \"imageUrl\": \"[Image URL 1]\" } },\n            { \"type\": \"native-image\", \"properties\": { \"imageUrl\": \"[Image URL 2]\" } },\n            { \"type\": \"native-image\", \"properties\": { \"imageUrl\": \"[Image URL 3]\" } }\n            //Add more images as needed\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n      \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"native-text\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"content\": \"Price: $650\",\n            \"textStyle\": \"Title/Medium\",\n            \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral90\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"native-text\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"content\": \"Condition: Good - Minor scratches on the bezel\",\n            \"textStyle\": \"Body/Medium\",\n            \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral50\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"native-text\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"content\": \"Seller Rating: 4.8 stars (120 reviews)\",\n            \"textStyle\": \"Body/Medium\",\n            \"color\": \"Neutral/neutral50\"\n          }\n        }\n          //Add more key information as needed using native-text\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"native-text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"content\": \"This Dell XPS 13 is in good condition with minor cosmetic wear.
