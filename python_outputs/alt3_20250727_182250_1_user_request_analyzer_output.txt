Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain for mobile application
User Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and notifications
Platform Impact: Mobile users need concise notification summaries, easily scannable information, and intuitive touch interactions.  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information presentation.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View recent notifications, understand notification content (title, description), track notification timestamps.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially navigate to the source of the notification from the notification itself.
User Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile,  touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.  Users need to quickly assess the importance of each notification.
Ready for handoff if: All five notification items are clearly visible and easily distinguishable.  Top bar and bottom navigation are functional and visually integrated. Touch targets meet minimum size requirements.  Visual hierarchy clearly prioritizes important information (e.g., title over description).

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of 5 notifications), user information in top bar.
Supporting:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., badge count).
Contextual:  Empty state message (if no notifications),  "Load more" indication if there are more notifications than displayed.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  List view for notifications, potentially vertically scrollable if more than 5 notifications are possible.
* Components: Top bar (containing user info), individual notification item components (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), bottom navigation bar.
* Styling:  Consistent styling across notification items, visual hierarchy to indicate importance.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification).
Secondary Actions:  Navigate to different sections via the bottom navigation.
Screen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (while fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indicators of which notifications are unread.  Feedback on loading or error states.
