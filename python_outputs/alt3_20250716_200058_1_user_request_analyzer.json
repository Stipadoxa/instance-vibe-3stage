  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management\nUser Type: Mobile app users managing their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive settings page with clear labels and easy navigation due to limited screen real estate and touch interaction.  The design must accommodate interruptions and prioritize essential settings.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal information, manage account preferences, control app behavior.\nSecondary Goals: Understand the meaning of less clear options (like \"Verified ID badge\"), easily find and adjust key settings.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential interruptions, limited attention span.\nReady for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are included, grouped logically, and use existing app components. Top and bottom app navigation is implemented.  Touch targets meet minimum size requirements.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (name, profile picture), Business details (if applicable), Access to Cars45 auction toggle, \"Verified ID\" badge explanation, Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats, Disable Feedback, Manage notifications, Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  Clear and concise labels for all settings.  \"What is it?\" explanations where needed.\nContextual:  State indicators (e.g., \"Active\" for Cars45 auction access).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  A single vertically scrolling list of settings grouped by category (as shown in the reference image).\n* Components: Utilize existing app components for list items, toggles, and other interactive elements.  Headers should be used to clearly delineate the setting groups as shown in the reference image (Personal details, Business details etc.)\n* Styling: Adhere to existing app styling guidelines.  Maintain consistency with color schemes and visual hierarchy from the reference image.  Ensure clear visual separation between setting groups.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Modify settings (e.g., changing phone number, toggling features).\nSecondary Actions: Access \"What is it?\" explanations for unclear settings.\nScreen States:  Default state displaying all settings, potential loading states during updates.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual feedback upon successful setting changes (e.g., confirmation message or updated toggle state).\n\n\n",
