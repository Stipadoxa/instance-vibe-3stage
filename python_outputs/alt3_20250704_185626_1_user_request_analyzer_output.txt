Domain & Context

Domain: E-commerce domain, specifically a mobile marketplace for product discovery and purchase.
User Type: Mobile users looking to buy and sell products within a specific geographic area (indicated by the "location" filter).  This implies a local marketplace context.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined, intuitive interface with large touch targets, efficient navigation, and quick loading times. Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of information and efficient use of space.  Location awareness is crucial for the "location" filter.


User Requirements

Primary Goals:  Find relevant products quickly and easily, understand product details clearly, initiate contact with sellers.
Secondary Goals: Save preferred products for later viewing, filter search results effectively, sell products through the app.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potentially unreliable network connectivity, interruptions during use.


Ready for handoff if:  The search bar is prominently displayed and easy to access, product cards are consistently sized and visually appealing with clear price and location information, filters are easily applied and removed, and all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes.


Content Requirements

Critical: Product photos, product titles, prices (with currency KSh), location of seller, seller contact information (possibly implicit).
Supporting: Discount percentages, number of results, seller ratings/reviews (if available), category icons, filter options (location, brand, etc.).
Contextual:  Loading indicators, error messages (e.g., no results found), filter chip states (active/inactive), saved product indicators.


Screen Requirements

Primary Actions: Search for products, filter results, view product details, contact seller.
Secondary Actions: Save product, toggle view (e.g., grid/list), sort results, access app navigation (bottom nav).
Screen States: Default (search results), loading state, no results state, filter applied state, product details view.
Feedback Needs: Clear visual feedback on filter application, real-time search results updates, loading indicators during search and data retrieval, confirmation of actions (saving, contacting seller).
