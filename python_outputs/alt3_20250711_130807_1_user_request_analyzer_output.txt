Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account
Secondary Goals: Create a new account, recover forgotten credentials
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions
Ready for handoff if: "Sign in" button is most prominent, "Sign up" button is clearly secondary, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets.

Content Requirements
Critical:  "Welcome" title, email field, password field, "Sign in" button, "Sign up" button
Supporting: Password recovery link (consider placement for optimal discoverability),  placeholder text for email and password fields.
Contextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout to maximize vertical space utilization on mobile.
* Components:  Header containing "Welcome" title, input fields for email and password (consider secure input types), "Sign in" button (primary, prominent styling), "Sign up" button (text-only, secondary styling).
* Styling:  Consider using platform-consistent styling guidelines for buttons and input fields to maintain a familiar user experience.  "Sign in" button should have clear visual prominence (e.g., bolder color, larger size).


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials
Secondary Actions: Sign up for an account
Screen States: Default state, loading state (during authentication), error state (for invalid credentials)
Feedback Needs:  Real-time validation for email format, clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.
