  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with user profile management and notification settings.\nUser Type: Mobile users managing their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise settings page with clear, tappable controls due to limited screen real estate and touch-only interaction.  They may be interrupted easily, so the design should be simple and intuitive.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify user profile information, manage notification preferences, log out of the application.\nSecondary Goals:  Easily locate settings options, understand notification settings' impact.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if:  All primary actions (profile editing, notification toggling, logout) are clearly visible and easily accessible with appropriate tap targets; clear visual hierarchy and grouping of settings is present.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User profile section (name, potentially profile picture, email address), notifications toggle (with clear on/off indication), logout button.\nSupporting:  Links to help/support, version information (optional).\nContextual:  Success/failure messages after profile updates or logout.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n\n* Layout:  Vertical scrolling list of settings.  Consider grouping related settings together visually.\n* Components:  Profile section (potentially using a card component), toggle switch for notifications, button for logout.\n* Styling:  Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application's mobile interface.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Edit user profile, toggle notifications, log out.\nSecondary Actions: Access help/support (if included).\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (if profile updates are asynchronous), success/failure states after actions.\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback on notification toggle state (on/off); success/failure messages after profile updates or logout; loading indicators if actions are asynchronous.\n",
