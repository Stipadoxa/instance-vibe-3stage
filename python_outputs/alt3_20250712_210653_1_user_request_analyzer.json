  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with performance monitoring and data visualization\nUser Type: Business users reviewing key performance indicators (KPIs) on a mobile device.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise overview, prioritizing key metrics.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring efficient use of space and potentially scrolling.  Touch interaction needs to be considered for all elements.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Quickly view key performance indicators (users, revenue, growth).\nSecondary Goals: Understand trends in user, revenue, and growth data over time. Potentially drill down into the detailed data behind each metric.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile, potential for network limitations affecting data loading.  Distractions and interruptions common on mobile.\nReady for handoff if: All three metric cards (users, revenue, growth) are clearly displayed, the chart placeholder is evident, and the header is present.  Touch targets are appropriately sized.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: \"Analytics Dashboard\" header, three metric cards (Users, Revenue, Growth) displaying numerical values and appropriate units, chart placeholder indicating data visualization area.\nSupporting: Units of measurement for each metric (e.g., users, $, percentage).  Loading indicators for data.\nContextual: Error messages if data fails to load, potentially data refresh option.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Single-screen dashboard layout with header, three metric cards above a chart section.  Vertical layout.\n*   **Components:** Header with title \"Analytics Dashboard\", three metric cards (each with a title, numerical value, and units), chart section (placeholder for a chart).\n*   **Styling:**  (Styling specifics not provided in request - to be determined based on broader design system)\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  View detailed data (potentially implied by tapping on metric cards or chart).\nSecondary Actions: Refresh data (potential).\nScreen States: Default state (data loaded), loading state (data fetching), error state (data load failure).\nFeedback Needs: Loading indicator while fetching data, clear error messages if data fails to load.\n",
