I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs referenced below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout utilizes a vertical structure. The top section contains the search bar and filter button. Below, a horizontal layout arranges product cards in a grid, automatically wrapping to accommodate different screen sizes.  `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` is applied to images within product cards to ensure they utilize the available width.  Consistent spacing (e.g., 16px padding, 8px grid spacing) is used for visual clarity and hierarchy.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user initiates by interacting with the search bar, filtering results with the filter button, and then browsing/selecting products from the grid.  The clear visual hierarchy guides the user's attention towards the product cards.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:12086` search-field component over a native text input because it provides integrated search functionality (search icon, clear button) within the design system.  I chose `10:3907` (Button) for the filter button for its pre-built visual style and interactive capabilities.  For product cards, I used the `147:3743` ("product card") component because it provides a flexible structure for product details, and it's the component directly meant for this purpose.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying product images within the `147:3743` card.  Therefore, I'm utilizing the `imageNodes` property within the `147:3743` component. This allows for displaying product images while maintaining design system consistency.  No other workaround is necessary.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Prominence is established by placing the search bar at the top, followed by the filter button. The product cards are the main focus with larger typography and image prominence. Consistent spacing and visual grouping further improve hierarchy.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:3907` button component, I've used the `"Size": "Medium"` and `"Color": "Green"` variants for visual appeal and balance with the other UI elements.  For the product card, I'll use the `grid` view variant.

8. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements were required as the design system provides adequate components for building this screen.
