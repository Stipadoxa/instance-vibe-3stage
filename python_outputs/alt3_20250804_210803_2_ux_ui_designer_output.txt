**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure.  The top section contains the search bar and filter button. The main section features a grid layout for product cards.  Consistent spacing of 16 pixels is used between major sections and 8 pixels between items within the grid.  Product images within the cards utilize `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` to maximize use of available width.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow starts with the search bar at the top for quick product searching. The filter button allows for refinement of search results. Products are displayed in a visually appealing grid, enabling easy browsing. Each product card provides essential information, facilitating quick decision-making.

4. **Component Choices:**  I chose the `10:12086` (search-field) component for the search bar due to its integrated search functionality and familiar design pattern.  I considered using a `native-text` input field coupled with a search icon, but the `search-field` component offers a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.  For the filter button, the `10:3907` (Button) component in its "Medium", "Filled", and "Green" variants provides a clear call to action,  I considered the "Outlined" variant, but the filled button conveys more prominence.  The `147:3743` (product card) component will be used for product display. I considered alternatives, but this component provides the necessary structure and placeholders for image, title, price, and rating attributes.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying star ratings.  To overcome this, I will use a combination of `native-circle` for the star icons (using a suitable semantic color from the design system to represent the rating), along with `native-text` for the numerical rating and review count. This approach provides a functional solution within the confines of the available design system.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Prominence is established through size and color. The search bar is the largest element, followed by the filter button. Product cards are equally sized, forming a clear grid.  The title in each product card is larger than other text elements, and the price and rating have stronger color contrast.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:3907` (Button) component, I selected the "Medium" size for better mobile usability and "Green" color due to its positive connotation of successful actions.  The "Filled" variant provides a more prominent visual cue, guiding the user's interaction. I chose the "grid" view variant for the product card (`147:3743`) to optimize mobile display and "normal" type to accommodate different product features.

8. **Native Element Justification:** As mentioned above, star rating display is not covered by existing components. The use of `native-circle` for star icons and `native-text` for numerical ratings effectively conveys the seller's rating information.
