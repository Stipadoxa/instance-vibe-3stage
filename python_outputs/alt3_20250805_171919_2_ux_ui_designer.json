  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to present information in a clear, top-to-bottom flow.  Each form element is given its own row within a container for proper spacing and alignment.  The \"Forgot Password\" link is placed below the form for accessibility.  The `itemSpacing` of the root container is set to 0 for seamless visual flow, while inner containers use `itemSpacing` to provide visual separation between elements.  Full-width input fields utilize `\"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"` to take up the available space.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward:  enter email, enter password, tap \"Login\".  The \"Forgot Password\" link provides a clear path for users who have forgotten their credentials.  The design prioritizes simplicity and ease of use to minimize user effort.\n\n4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:8492` (\"text input\") component for the email and password fields because it's a standard, purpose-built component for this type of input. This was preferred over manually creating input fields with native elements, which would be more complex and less consistent with the design system.  I selected the `10:3907` (\"Button\") component for the \"Login\" button, again for design system consistency and optimal user experience and visual appeal over creating a button with native shapes.  There is no \"link\" component found in DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA. This is documented under Component Gaps.\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The user request requires a \"link\" component for the \"Forgot Password\" functionality, however no suitable component was found in the design system.  Therefore, I've implemented a workaround using a `native-text` element styled as a link. This provides the necessary functionality and user guidance while still maintaining overall design consistency.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through clear spacing, alignment, and the use of standard text styles, with \"Login\" being the prominent call to action at the bottom. \n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:3907` (\"Button\") component, I selected the `Size: \"Medium\"` and `State: \"Default\"` variants as these fit the visual context of a typical login button.  Alternatives like \"Large\" might make the button too dominant, while \"Pressed\" or \"Hover\" states are relevant only when the user interacts with the button.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:**  As stated above, the \"Forgot Password\" link's functionality cannot be achieved using any components present in the design system. Therefore, a `native-text` element has been employed to style the link.\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Login Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 32, \"paddingBottom\": 32, \"paddingLeft\": 16, \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\", \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 8,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:8492\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n              \"State\": \"enabled\"\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"placeholder-text\": \"Email Address\",\n              \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:8492\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n              \"State\": \"enabled\"\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"placeholder-text\": \"Password\",\n              \"horizontalSizing\": \"FILL\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n          \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n          \"Type\": \"Filled\",\n          \"State\": \"Default\",\n          \"Color\": \"Green\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"Action\": \"Login\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"native-text\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"content\": \"Forgot Password?\",\n          \"textStyle\": \"Body/Small\",\n          \"color\": \"primary-500\",\n          \"alignment\": \"center\",\n          \"textDecoration\": \"underline\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
