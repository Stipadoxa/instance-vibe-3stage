Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.
Secondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options like social login or biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID).
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential for security risks.
Ready for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and sufficient padding exists between elements for touch targets.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area.
Supporting: Password recovery link,  "Remember me" checkbox, social login options (if applicable), account creation link.
Contextual: Security notices (e.g., padlock icon), loading indicator during authentication,  help/support access (link or icon).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Social login (if applicable), create new account, access help/support.
Screen States: Default state, loading state, error state (incorrect credentials, network error), success state (redirect to next screen).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (visual cues), clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., brief success message).
