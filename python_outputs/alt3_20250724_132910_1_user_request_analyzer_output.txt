Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile app access
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to log in to their accounts.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive login experience optimized for touch interaction, potentially interrupted use, and smaller screen real estate.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Successfully authenticate and access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for faster access; recover forgotten credentials.
User Constraints: Limited screen space; touch-only interaction; potential for interruptions; varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (fields, buttons) have sufficient tap targets; error messages are clearly displayed; password recovery flow is linked; T&C acceptance is indicated.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field; password field; primary login button; social media login buttons; password recovery link.
Supporting:  T&C acceptance footnote.
Contextual: Error messages for invalid credentials; loading indicators during authentication.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical layout, placing fields above the main button, followed by social media login buttons, password recovery link, and T&C footnote.
* Components:  Text input fields (username/email, password); primary button ("Log In"); social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google); hyperlink for password recovery; text for T&C footnote.
* Styling:  Refer to provided visual reference for color schemes, typography, and button styles. Maintain consistency with the app's existing design system.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login using credentials; login via social media.
Secondary Actions: Initiate password recovery.
Screen States: Default (initial screen); loading; error (invalid credentials); success (redirection to app content).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email/username format; clear error messages for login failures; visual feedback during authentication (loading indicator).
