Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.  Context: Users need to quickly review and manage their notifications.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise information display, touch interaction, and consideration for limited screen real estate.  Notifications should be easily scannable and actionable within the constraints of a small screen.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read, dismiss notifications, and potentially navigate to the source of each notification.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential interruptions while viewing notifications, need for quick comprehension of notification content.
Ready for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation bar is present; and all elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction and mobile screen dimensions.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in the top bar.
Supporting:  Notification read status indicator (e.g., visual cue for unread notifications).
Contextual:  Empty state message if no notifications are present.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical list layout for notifications, top bar for user info, bottom navigation bar.
* Components: Top Bar (User Avatar, User Name/Initials), Notification Item (User Avatar, Title, Description, Timestamp), Bottom Navigation Bar (Tab Icons/Labels).
* Styling:  Consistent styling with the rest of the application.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification item).
Secondary Actions: Mark as read (potentially a swipe-to-dismiss action or a dedicated button), dismiss notification (potentially a swipe-to-dismiss action or a dedicated button).
Screen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (if fetching notifications).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual cues for unread notifications, smooth scrolling, appropriate loading indicators.
