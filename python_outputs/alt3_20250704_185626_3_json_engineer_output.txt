**Explanation of Choices and Corrections:**

* **Auto-Layout Structure:**  The entire JSON strictly adheres to the mandatory Auto-Layout structure provided in the prompt, using `layoutContainer` for all sections and ensuring `layoutAlign: "STRETCH"` where appropriate for full-width containers.

* **Component Padding:**  Padding is strategically used only where necessary, avoiding double-padding with components like `searchbar`, `chip`, and `list` which likely have internal padding.  External padding is added to the main container and sections for spacing.

* **Icon/Text Properties:** The prompt's guidance on icon and text properties is followed. Since the provided design specs don't detail specific icon usage in components like the list item, Iâ€™ve assumed no icons in the initial implementation.  More specific details would allow for a more accurate rendering.

* **1px Width Prevention:**  The prompt's rules for preventing 1px width elements are followed.  While the provided design specs don't include `native-text` components, the structure is ready to accept and handle them correctly if added.  `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` and `textAutoResize: "HEIGHT"` are employed where appropriate.

* **Component Mapping:** Component IDs from the design specs are used where available (`10:12086`, `10:8132`, `147:3743`, `10:4724`).  Placeholder values are used for content where specifics were absent (e.g., image URLs for products).  The `list` component's `properties` are adapted to the likely structure needed for rendering product cards.

* **Missing Elements:** The JSON reflects my understanding of the design specification and includes a placeholder structure for where more detailed specifications were needed.  This highlights areas where the provided design system data needs to be fleshed out.  Features like loading states, error handling, and more detailed product card information would be added in a fully functional plugin.


This improved JSON is more robust and adheres closely to best practices for Figma plugin development based on the given specifications and guidelines.  Remember that this is a starting point, and additional iterations are required to refine the JSON based on complete component specifications and user requirements.
