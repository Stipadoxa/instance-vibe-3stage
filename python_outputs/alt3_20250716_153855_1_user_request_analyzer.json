Each setting item should occupy a full screen width, with a clear visual separator. Top and bottom app navigation bars are to be included.\n* Components: Utilize existing app components for list items, switches, buttons, text fields, and navigation.\n* Styling: Maintain consistency with the existing app's styling and visual language, using the reference image as a guide for the overall layout and visual hierarchy.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Modify settings, navigate to account deletion confirmation if needed, logout.\nSecondary Actions: Access \"What is it?\" information regarding the \"Verified ID\" badge.\nScreen States:  Default state displaying all settings, loading state during updates, success and error states for setting changes.\nFeedback Needs:  Visual confirmation of successful setting changes (e.g., checkmark, updated display of the setting value), clear and concise error messages for invalid inputs.\n",
