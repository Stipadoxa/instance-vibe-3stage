  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display, touch interaction, and consideration for screen real estate limitations.  The design must account for interruptions and potential background processes.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals: Quickly assess the importance of each notification, potentially interact with each notification (e.g., mark as read, take action based on notification).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch interactions, potential for interruptions while viewing notifications.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications; User information in top bar.\nSupporting:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., badge count).\nContextual:  Potentially a \"mark as read\" option for each notification, actions related to the notification content (e.g., a link to a specific page).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list of notifications, each notification in a separate row. Top bar at the top of the screen; bottom navigation at the bottom of the screen.\n* Components: Top bar (containing user info), Notification Item (containing user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation (containing navigation elements).\n* Styling:  Appropriate styling for all UI elements to align with the overall application design.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details.\nSecondary Actions: Mark as read (potential), take action based on notification (potential).\nScreen States: Default state (showing five notifications), empty state (no notifications), loading state (if loading notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indicators of unread notifications, smooth scrolling of the notification list.\n",
