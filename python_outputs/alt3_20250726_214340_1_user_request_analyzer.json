  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage and view their notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display of information, prioritization of critical notifications, and consideration of touch interactions. Limited screen real estate requires efficient use of space.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals: Potentially mark notifications as read, potentially dismiss notifications.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices, need for clear and concise notification display, potential for many notifications.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all content is legible and touch targets are appropriately sized.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications; user information in top bar; bottom navigation items.\nSupporting:  Notification read status indicator (e.g., bold or faded text).\nContextual:  Indication of unread notifications count (perhaps in the top bar or bottom navigation).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Top bar (containing user info - possibly profile picture and name), individual notification items (each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp), bottom navigation (with multiple tabs).\n* Styling:  Consider clear visual hierarchy to distinguish between read and unread notifications.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification item).\nSecondary Actions: Mark notifications as read, dismiss notifications.  Actions might be implicit (tap to mark as read) or explicit (separate button).\nScreen States: Default state (showing notifications), potentially a loading state (if fetching notifications), and an empty state (no notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indicators for read/unread notifications, appropriate feedback when a notification is marked as read or dismissed.\n",
