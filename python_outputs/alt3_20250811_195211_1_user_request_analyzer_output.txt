**STAGE 1 ANALYSIS:**
This is an e-commerce request for an unclear platform (mobile or desktop could work). The user wants to create a detailed product page for a used laptop to facilitate its sale.


**STAGE 2 CORE CONTENT:**

*Screen Purpose*: To display all relevant information about a used laptop for sale, allowing potential buyers to make an informed decision and contact the seller.

*Primary Content*:
- Heading: "2020 Dell XPS 13 - Excellent Condition - $600"
- Key Information:
    - Multiple high-quality images of the laptop (different angles, showing keyboard, ports, etc.)
    - Price: $600
    - Condition: Excellent (with a visual rating scale such as 5 stars)
    - Detailed condition description: "Minor cosmetic scratches on the bottom case; otherwise, perfect working order. Battery life approximately 8 hours."

- Empty State:  (Should ideally not show on a product page, as it only appears when no listing is available) If ever used:  "No laptops currently available."
