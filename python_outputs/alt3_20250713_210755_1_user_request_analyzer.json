  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management and settings configuration.  Specific context is a mobile application likely related to auctions or a similar marketplace.\nUser Type: Mobile users of the Cars45 auction app needing to manage their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily navigable settings page with clear touch targets, given the limitations of screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  The design must account for interruptions and potential variations in network connectivity.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal account settings, manage notification preferences, and securely log out of the application.\nSecondary Goals:  Review business details, understand account status indicators (e.g., \"Verified ID\" badge), access help or information resources.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile devices, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during use, and the need for clear and concise information presentation.\nReady for handoff if: All settings options from the reference image are included, using the provided design system components.  Navigation is intuitive and clear.  Touch targets meet minimum size requirements and all interactive elements are clearly identifiable.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Personal details (editable), Business details (viewable/editable), Access to Cars45 auction (status display and potentially toggle), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats, Disable Feedback, Manage notifications, Change password, Delete account permanently, Log out.\nSupporting:  \"Verified ID\" badge with explanation (\"What is it?\" link/modal),  Clear visual indicators of active/inactive settings.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid input, loading indicators for actions that require network requests.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical list of settings options, similar to the reference image.  Each option should use consistent design system components.\n* Components:  Use pre-existing components from the design system (as specified). This includes list items for settings, navigation components, and input fields as needed.  Use the visual style from the reference image but adapted to the design system.\n* Styling:  Follow the overall styling guidelines of the provided design system.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Navigating to specific setting sections, modifying settings values (e.g., changing email, password), initiating account deletion, logging out.\nSecondary Actions: Accessing help information for specific settings, viewing business details.\nScreen States: Default state showing all settings, loading state while saving changes, success/error states after submitting changes.\nFeedback Needs:  Confirmation of setting changes, visual feedback indicating progress of long-running tasks (e.g., saving changes), and clear error messages for invalid inputs.\n",
