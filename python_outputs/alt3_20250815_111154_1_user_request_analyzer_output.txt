## STAGE 1: UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST

1. **Domain**: E-commerce (specifically, a marketplace showing sellers).
2. **Platform**: Unclear, but will default to mobile in Stage 3.
3. **User Goal**: To display a concise summary of a seller's information (avatar and rating) within a list or feed of sellers.


## STAGE 2: GENERATE CORE CONTENT

**Main Screen Purpose**: To present a list of sellers, allowing users to quickly identify and select sellers based on their avatar and rating.  This is likely part of a larger product listing or search results page.


**Required Information & Actions**:

* **Heading**:  (Not applicable at the row level; this is a single row within a larger list)

* **Key Information Blocks**:
    * **Avatar Image:** A square profile picture of the seller (e.g., 50x50 pixels).  If no image is available, display a default placeholder image (a generic icon or initials). Example:  `[Display Seller Avatar]`
    * **Seller Name:** The seller's display name. Example: `Jane's Handmade Crafts`
    * **Seller Rating:** A star rating (e.g., 4.8 out of 5 stars)  alongside the number of ratings in parentheses. Example: `⭐⭐⭐⭐ (123)`

* **Primary & Secondary Actions**:
    * **Primary:** Tap/Click on the entire row to navigate to the seller's full profile page.
    *(No secondary action is explicitly required at the row level.  Additional actions may exist on the seller's profile page.)*

* **Required Status Indicators**: None explicitly required at the row level.


## STAGE 3: ADD NAVIGATION (Mobile App Default)

**Top Navigation**: (Not applicable for a single row within a larger list view)

**Bottom Navigation**:  Assuming this seller row is part of a larger product browsing experience:

* **Home:**  Icon: House icon
* **Browse:** Icon: List icon
* **Cart:** Icon: Shopping cart icon
* **Profile:** Icon: Person icon


**Example of a complete seller row (for implementation):**

```
[50x50px Avatar Image]  |  Jane's Handmade Crafts  ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (123)
```
(The vertical bar "|" represents the visual separation between the avatar and text; the actual implementation would use appropriate layout techniques.)
