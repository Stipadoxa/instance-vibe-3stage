  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain specifically a marketplace app with product discovery\nUser Type: Mobile users browsing and filtering products within a marketplace app.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and efficient search results page with easy-to-use filters due to screen size limitations and touch interaction.  Results should load quickly to avoid user frustration. Location awareness could be used to filter by proximity.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View relevant search results, refine search results using filters.\nSecondary Goals: Sort results by relevance, price, or other criteria; view product details quickly; navigate to product pages.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size limits the number of results and filter options displayed at once; touch-based interaction requires large, easily tappable elements; users may have slow or unreliable network connections.\nReady for handoff if:  Filter chips are clearly visible and easily selectable; search results are displayed in a visually appealing and easily scannable format; loading indicators are present for network requests;  minimum tappable areas meet mobile design standards; and pagination/infinite scrolling is implemented smoothly.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Search results (product images, titles, prices); filter chips (categories, price range, etc.); pagination or infinite scrolling;  indication of total number of results.\nSupporting:  Sorting options (e.g., relevance, price, newest);  product ratings and reviews (summary or count);  distance filtering (if location-aware).\nContextual:  \"No results found\" message; loading indicator; error messages for network issues; filter chip selection states.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  List or grid layout for search results, clearly separated from filter chips (perhaps above or below).\n* Components: Filter chips (using Material Design or similar guidelines for consistent visual language), Product cards (image, title, price, rating summary), pagination/infinite scroll component, clear heading indicating search query.\n* Styling:  Use of brand colors and typography; clear visual hierarchy to prioritize important information.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Selecting filter chips, tapping on a product to view details.\nSecondary Actions: Sorting results, navigating to next/previous pages.\nScreen States:  Default state (showing initial results); loading state (while fetching results/applying filters); \"no results\" state; error state (network issues).\nFeedback Needs: Visual feedback when a filter chip is selected; loading indicators for network requests; clear error messages with actionable steps.\n",
