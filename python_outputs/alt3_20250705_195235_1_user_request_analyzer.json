  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain specifically a marketplace app with product search and filtering.\nUser Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products within a marketplace app.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and efficient search results page with clear filtering options due to screen size limitations and touch interaction.  They may be using the app in various contexts (e.g., commuting, shopping at home), requiring a distraction-free experience.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View search results relevant to their query, filter results based on specified criteria, easily access product details.\nSecondary Goals: Sort results by relevance, price, or other attributes; refine search query; save or share search results.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices, touch-based interaction, potential for slow network connections, users may be easily distracted.\nReady for handoff if:  Search results are clearly displayed, filter chips are easily accessible and interactive, product cards include essential information (image, title, price), and loading states are handled gracefully.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: List of search results (product cards with image, title, price), filter chips (representing available filter categories and selections), clear indication of total number of results.\nSupporting:  Pagination for many results, sorting options (e.g., price: low to high, best match), \"view more\" option to expand filter criteria.\nContextual:  \"No results found\" message for empty searches, loading indicator while fetching results, updated result count after filtering.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n\n*   **Layout:**  Vertical list of product cards, filter chips positioned above the results list (potentially scrollable if many filters).\n*   **Components:** Product cards (image, title, price, possibly rating), Filter chips (interactive, clearly labeled), pagination controls (if applicable).\n*   **Styling:**  Consistent with overall marketplace app styling, clear visual hierarchy between filter chips and search results, use of whitespace for readability.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View product details, apply filters, refine search query.\nSecondary Actions: Sort results, change pagination, clear filters.\nScreen States: Initial state (displaying search results), loading state, filtered state, \"no results\" state.\nFeedback Needs: Visual feedback (e.g., highlighting selected filters), loading indicators during data fetching, clear visual distinction between applied and unapplied filters, updated result count after filtering or sorting.\n",
