  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile app users who need to view and manage incoming notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display, touch-based interaction, and consideration for screen real estate limitations.  Notifications must be easily scannable due to potential interruptions and limited attention spans.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View incoming notifications, understand notification content (image, title, subtitle), and potentially take action based on notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Manage notifications (e.g., mark as read, dismiss), access notification settings (potentially through bottom navigation).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions impacting image loading.\nReady for handoff if:  All critical content is displayed clearly and concisely, touch targets are appropriately sized, and navigation is intuitive.  Visual hierarchy prioritizes unread notifications.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: List of notifications (each with image, title, subtitle, and timestamp).\nSupporting:  Number of unread notifications (badge or counter).\nContextual:  Loading indicator for images, empty state message (\"No notifications\"),  \"Mark all as read\" action (potentially).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   Layout: Vertical list of notifications.  Notifications are displayed individually with image, title, subtitle, and timestamp in a horizontal layout.\n*   Components: Top app bar (with title/back button), Notification list items (image, title, subtitle, timestamp), Bottom navigation bar.\n*   Styling:  Appropriate styling to visually distinguish read vs unread notifications.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification).\nSecondary Actions: Mark as read (potentially swipe-to-dismiss), access notification settings (through bottom nav).\nScreen States: Default (showing notifications), Loading (while fetching notifications), Empty (no notifications), Error (failure to load notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Loading indicator while fetching notifications, visual cue for read/unread notifications.\n",
