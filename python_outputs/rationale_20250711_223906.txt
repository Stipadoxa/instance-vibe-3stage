📋 Analyzed Requirements:
User Requirements
Primary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase

🔧 Engineer Rationale:
{
  "implementationRationale": {
    "componentSelection": "Component IDs (10:7816, 10:3907) were directly taken from the input JSON as they represent specific image and button components from the design system.  No changes were made.",
    "styleApplication": "Text styles ('Title/Medium', 'Body/Large') and color styles ('Neutral/neutral90', 'Primary/primary50') are directly applied as specified in the input JSON.  This maintains consistency with the design system.",
    "designSystemMapping": "The input JSON already maps design elements to components and styles from the design system. No further mapping was needed. The image uses a single image variant.",
    "variantDecisions": "Button variants ('Size': 'Large', 'Type': 'Filled', 'Color': 'Green', 'State': 'Default') were selected as provided in the input JSON. Image variant 'Type': '1 image' was used as provided. No modifications were performed."
