I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout to naturally guide the user through the form fields.  Each input field is given sufficient spacing for readability and clarity. The "Forgot Password" link is placed below the login button for discoverability and logical flow. The `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` property is used on the root container to ensure the entire screen width is utilized.  Consistent 16px padding is applied around the form container to create visual breathing room on a mobile screen.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward: 1) Enter email, 2) Enter password, 3) Tap "Login".  The "Forgot Password" link provides an escape route for users who have forgotten their credentials. The vertical flow and clear labeling of fields minimize cognitive load.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:8492` (text input) component for the email and password fields because it provides built-in placeholder text and clear visual feedback for different states (e.g., focused, error).  I considered using the `10:8619` (text area) component, but it's unsuitable for single-line input.  No other component provides the required security features for password input.  For the button, I selected component `10:3907` as it directly supports "Login" button functionality and visual appearance, while a `native-rectangle` would require additional styling to achieve the same UX.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "Forgot Password" link component. Therefore, I implemented a workaround using a `native-text` element styled as a hyperlink. This provides the needed functionality while maintaining a consistent visual style with the rest of the screen.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through clear spacing, prominent button placement, and distinct typography. The input labels are clearly defined, and the "Login" button is visually larger and more prominent than other elements.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `10:8492` (text input) component, I chose the `Type: "Filled"` and `State: "enabled"` variants because a filled input visually indicates an active field. The `State: "focused"` variant will change based on user interaction. For the `10:3907` (button) component, I used  `Size: "Medium"`, `Type: "Filled"`, `State: "Default"`, and `Color: "Green"` variants to meet the visual design intent and user expectations for a login button.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  The "Forgot Password" link requires a simple text element with clickable functionality, which cannot be accomplished with the components provided.  The `native-text` element directly addresses this need.
