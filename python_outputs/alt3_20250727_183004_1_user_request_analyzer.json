  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise information display, efficient touch interactions, and consideration for screen real estate limitations.  Notifications must be easily scannable and actionable within the constraints of a mobile screen.\n\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Quickly assess the importance of notifications, access related content or actions from each notification.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All five notification items are clearly displayed, user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are legible and properly aligned for each notification, top bar user info and bottom navigation are present and functional, and the screen is free of visual clutter.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), User information in top bar (at minimum, user's name or profile image).\nSupporting:  Number of unread notifications (badge or counter), ability to mark notifications as read.\nContextual:  Loading indicator (if fetching notifications), empty state message (if no notifications).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Notification Item (repeating component showing avatar, title, description, timestamp), Top Bar (containing user information), Bottom Navigation (containing navigation elements).\n* Styling:  Clear visual hierarchy to distinguish between notification elements.  Appropriate font sizes for readability on mobile.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (potentially by tapping on a notification item).\nSecondary Actions: Mark notifications as read (potentially via a swipe gesture or button), access settings related to notifications.\nScreen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), loading state, empty state (no notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of which notifications are read/unread, loading indicator while fetching notifications, appropriate feedback after marking a notification as read.\n",
