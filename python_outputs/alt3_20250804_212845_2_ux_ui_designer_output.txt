I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure. The top section features a full-width image gallery using native-rectangle elements for image placeholders to accommodate varying numbers of product photos. This is followed by sections for the product title, price (using  `native-text` with a primary color), condition details, seller profile (incorporating an avatar component and a rating), product description (using `native-text`), and finally, a "Contact Seller" button. Consistent spacing of 16px is used between major sections to improve readability and visual separation.  Full-width elements (`horizontalSizing`: `"FILL"`) are used where appropriate (image placeholders and text sections) to maximize screen real estate.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flows from top to bottom, starting with visually engaging product images and moving to essential information (title, price, condition).  The seller profile and rating build trust.  The description provides details, and the prominent button drives the desired action (contacting the seller).

4. **Component Choices:** I chose `native-rectangle` components for image placeholders because  the design system lacks a dedicated, flexible image gallery component that can easily handle multiple images in a scrollable format, and I needed to maintain flexibility for an indeterminate number of images.  No other component in the design system efficiently serves this purpose. The button component (`10:3907`) is used for the "Contact Seller" call to action due to its robust styling options and consistent design within the system.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying a product image gallery and a combined seller profile with rating.  Therefore, I used a combination of `native-rectangle` elements for image placeholders within a `layoutContainer` and a combination of `native-text`, `10:7773` (Avatar), and `native-rating` (created using native elements) to achieve the necessary functionality.  This approach prioritizes efficient image display and clear presentation of the seller's credibility.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through size, placement, and color.  The hero image gallery takes visual precedence.  The product title and price are prominently displayed in larger text sizes. The seller profile, condition, and description follow in decreasing order of importance based on their text sizes. The "Contact Seller" button is styled with a primary color and prominent placement.


7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** The button (`10:3907`) uses the "Filled", "Medium", "Default", and "Green" variants for high visibility and clear call to action. The default state ensures it is immediately interactive.


8. **Native Element Justification:**  Native elements (`native-rectangle`, `native-text`, and `native-rating`) were used for the image gallery, price, description, and rating to handle the flexible layout requirements for images and the combined rating and profile display. This allowed a flexible design that easily handles variations in product image numbers and seller profile information, capabilities not provided by the existing components alone.
