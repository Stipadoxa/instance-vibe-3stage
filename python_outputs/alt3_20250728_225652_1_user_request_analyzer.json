  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage and view notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Limited screen real estate requires efficient information display. Touch interaction necessitates large tap targets.  Interruptions are common, so the screen should be quickly scannable.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially mark notifications as read or dismiss them.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile device, touch interaction only, potential for interruptions, need for quick understanding of notification content.\nReady for handoff if: All five notification items are clearly displayed and distinguishable, user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are present for each, top bar user info and bottom navigation are implemented and functional,  and touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, title, description, and timestamp for each of the five notifications.  User information in the top bar (at minimum, user's name or initials). Bottom navigation icons and labels.\nSupporting:  Indicator to show notification as read/unread.  Option to dismiss individual notifications or all at once.\nContextual:  Empty state message if there are no notifications.  Loading indicator if notifications are being fetched.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical list of notifications, each in a separate card or row. Top bar at the top, bottom navigation bar at the bottom.\n*   **Components:** Notification Card (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Top Bar (user info), Bottom Navigation (multiple tabs).\n*   **Styling:**  Appropriate spacing and padding to ensure readability and usability on mobile.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping a notification).\nSecondary Actions: Mark as read, dismiss notifications (individually or all).\nScreen States: Default state (notifications displayed), empty state (no notifications), loading state (fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of read/unread notifications.  Loading indicator while fetching notifications. Haptic feedback on interaction (optional, but recommended).\n",
