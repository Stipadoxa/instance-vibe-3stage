  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (e.g., social login, biometric authentication if applicable)\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential for distractions.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, password recovery link is clearly visible and easily accessible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction, error messages have designated space and are clear, and sufficient spacing exists between elements to prevent accidental taps.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area\nSupporting: Password recovery link,  \"Remember me\" checkbox (optional, consider security implications),  link to account creation (if applicable)\nContextual: Loading indicator during authentication, specific error messages for invalid credentials (e.g., \"incorrect password\", \"invalid email\"), security notices (e.g., secure connection indicator).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery\nSecondary Actions: Create new account (if applicable), access help or support\nScreen States: Default state (form fields ready for input), loading state (during authentication), error state (displaying error messages), success state (redirecting to the user's account).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format and password strength (visual cues), clear and concise error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., brief success message or immediate transition to the next screen).\n",
