  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: E-commerce domain focusing on product display and purchase initiation.\nUser Type: Mobile shoppers browsing product listings.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need concise information, large tappable areas, and a streamlined purchasing process.  Screen real estate is limited, requiring prioritization of essential information.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase.\nSecondary Goals:  Potentially view product ratings/reviews (if space allows), access additional product information (e.g., via a \"details\" link).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during browsing.\nReady for handoff if:  Image is prominent, title is clear and concise, price is easily readable, \"Buy\" button is large and clearly distinguishable, and all elements have sufficient tappable areas.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Product image, product title, product price, \"Buy\" button.\nSupporting:  Short product description (if space allows),  ratings/reviews (if space allows).\nContextual:  \"Out of Stock\" message if applicable, loading indicator while fetching product data.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single vertical column layout for optimal use of limited screen space\n* Components:  Image (responsive sizing), Title (clear and concise), Price (prominently displayed), Buy Button (large, clear call to action)\n* Styling:  Consistent with overall app style guide.  Price should be visually distinct.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Add to cart/Buy now.\nSecondary Actions: View details (potentially), view similar products (potentially, depending on design).\nScreen States: Default state, \"Out of Stock\" state, loading state.\nFeedback Needs:  Visual confirmation of adding to cart/purchase initiation, clear error messages (if applicable).\n",
