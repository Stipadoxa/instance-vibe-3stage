  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below are verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical list (`layoutMode: \"VERTICAL\"`) to present each notification setting.  Each setting is a list item (`10:10214`) with a leading toggle switch (`10:9912`) and descriptive text. Consistent spacing of 16 points is used between list items (`itemSpacing: 16`).  The use of a vertical list ensures a clear and organized display of settings, preventing overwhelming the user with too much information at once.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:**  The user can easily scan the list of notification types and immediately toggle each one on or off using the switches.  The descriptive text accompanying each toggle clarifies the notification's purpose.  This design prioritizes simplicity and direct interaction for quick and intuitive preference management.\n\n4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `list-item` component (`10:10214`) with a leading `switch` component (`10:9912`) for each notification setting.  Alternatives considered were using a series of individual toggle switches with labels, which would lead to a less organized and visually less appealing display.  The selected option provides a cleaner structure, promoting readability and usability.\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system does not have a dedicated component to combine a toggle switch and label within a list item. The `10:10214` component, however, supports the combination of a leading `switch` and text label. No gap needed to be addressed.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the vertical layout of the list, ensuring clear distinction between the notification types. The consistent use of the list item component provides structural consistency and prevents visual clutter.\n\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `switch` component (`10:9912`), the `State: \"enabled\"` variant was chosen to ensure that the toggles are interactive. The `Selected: \"false\"` variant is the initial state.  No other variants are necessary because the design specifically does not require the `disabled` or `Icon` variants of this component.\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements are required, as the design system's components sufficiently meet all functional requirements.\n\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Notification Settings Screen\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n    \"paddingTop\": 16,\n    \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n    \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n    \"paddingRight\": 16,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"None\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"False\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"Headline\": \"Push Notifications\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive push notifications for important updates.\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"None\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"False\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"Headline\": \"Email Alerts\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive email alerts for critical events.\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"None\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"False\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"Headline\": \"SMS Updates\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive SMS updates for time-sensitive information.\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:10214\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Condition\": \"1-line\",\n          \"Leading\": \"Switch\",\n          \"Trailing\": \"None\",\n          \"Show overline\": \"False\",\n          \"Show supporting text\": \"False\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"Headline\": \"Promotional Offers\",\n          \"Supporting text\": \"Receive notifications about special offers and discounts.\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
