  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Notification domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile app users who need to view and manage their notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates a concise layout, intuitive touch interactions, and consideration for limited screen real estate.  Notifications must be easily scannable due to potential interruptions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals:  Navigate to the source of a notification (if applicable), mark notifications as read, potentially manage notification settings (though this might be a separate screen).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch interactions, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if:  All notification items display correctly with image, title, subtitle, and timestamp;  navigation is clear and intuitive;  touch targets are appropriately sized.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: List of notifications (image, title, subtitle, timestamp).\nSupporting:  Notification count indicator (in app icon or elsewhere).\nContextual:  Indication of unread notifications (e.g., bolding, visual cue).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical list of notifications, possibly grouped by type or date.\n*   **Components:** Top app bar (likely with title and back button), list items (image, title, subtitle, timestamp), bottom navigation bar (with other app sections).\n*   **Styling:**  Consistent with overall app styling, clear visual separation between notification items.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on an item).\nSecondary Actions: Mark notifications as read (swipe action, check box, etc.).\nScreen States:  Default (showing a list of notifications), Empty state (no notifications), Loading state (fetching notifications).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of read/unread status, loading indicator while fetching new notifications, confirmation that a notification has been marked as read.\n",
