  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: User settings management within a mobile application.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates a concise layout, clear touch targets, and consideration for interruptions and limited screen real estate.  Navigation must be intuitive due to the smaller screen size.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal details, change contact information, change language preferences, delete account.\nSecondary Goals:  Log out of the application securely.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during use.\nReady for handoff if: All primary actions are clearly accessible and labeled, top app bar and bottom navigation are implemented correctly, and touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details section (displaying current information), \"Change phone number\" action, \"Change email\" action, \"Change language\" selection, \"Delete my account permanently\" action, \"Log out\" action.\nSupporting:  Clear indication of successful changes, confirmation dialogs before irreversible actions (account deletion).\nContextual:  Error messages for invalid inputs, loading indicators during data updates.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical list of settings items.  Top app bar and bottom navigation bar.\n*   **Components:** Top app bar (containing app title or logo, potentially a back button), list items (each with a label and action - either direct edit or navigation to a secondary screen), bottom navigation bar (with other application sections).\n*   **Styling:**  Adherence to the application's existing style guide (assuming one exists).\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Modify personal details, change phone number, change email, change language, delete account, log out.\nSecondary Actions:  (Potentially) access help or support related to settings.\nScreen States: Default state (displaying current settings), loading state (during data updates), success state (after successful changes), error state (after invalid input or failed action).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear confirmation messages after successful actions, informative error messages for failed actions, visual indication of loading or processing.\n",
