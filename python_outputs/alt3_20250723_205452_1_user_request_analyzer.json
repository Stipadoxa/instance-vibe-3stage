  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.\nUser Type: Mobile application users attempting to access their accounts.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users require a streamlined, touch-friendly interface with clear visual hierarchy due to screen size limitations and potential for interruptions.  Design must consider varying network conditions and touch-only interaction.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Securely authenticate and access the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize convenient social media login options; recover forgotten credentials.\nUser Constraints: Small screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) meet minimum touch target size requirements; password recovery and terms & conditions are clearly accessible; error states are defined and visually distinct.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button,  password recovery link, terms & conditions footnote.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons.\nContextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials or network issues), loading indicators.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column layout, with input fields above the primary button, followed by social login buttons and then the password recovery link and T&C footnote.\n* Components:  Input fields (username/email, password), Primary button (\"Log In\"), Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google),  Password recovery link (e.g., \"Forgot Password?\"), Text indicating acceptance of T&C.  (e.g., \"By logging in, you agree to our Terms & Conditions.\")\n* Styling:  Refer to provided visual reference for styling cues, paying attention to color palette, typography, and spacing.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login using credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Login via social media accounts.\nScreen States: Default state (fields visible, buttons enabled), loading state (indicator displayed), error state (relevant error messages displayed), success state (redirect to app).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time input validation (for email format and password strength, where applicable), informative error messages, loading indicators.\n",
