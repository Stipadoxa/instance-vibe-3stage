Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of essential information.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Successfully authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize social media logins for faster access; recover lost credentials.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for distractions, reliance on mobile network connectivity.\nReady for handoff if:  All fields are appropriately sized for touch interaction, error messages are clearly displayed, and all interactive elements (buttons and links) meet minimum tappable area guidelines.  Password recovery and Terms & Conditions are clearly linked.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), \"Forgot Password\" link.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication.  Terms & Conditions acceptance footnote.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical layout with input fields stacked above the primary login button, followed by social login buttons and then the password recovery link and T&C footnote.\n* Components:  Input fields (username/email, password) with appropriate keyboard types; Primary button (\"Log In\"); Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google icons); \"Forgot Password?\" link; Footnote indicating acceptance of T&C.\n* Styling:  Consistent with the visual style of the provided reference image (clean, light background, clear text hierarchy, appropriate spacing).\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Log in with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Log in via social media accounts.\nScreen States: Default (input fields visible), Loading (indicator displayed), Error (error message displayed), Success (transition to app main screen).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation feedback on input fields (e.g., email format validation), clear error messages for login failures, visual feedback during authentication (loading indicator).\n",
