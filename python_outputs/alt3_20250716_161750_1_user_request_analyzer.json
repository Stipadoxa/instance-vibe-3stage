Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of settings.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage notification preferences, log out of the application.\nSecondary Goals:  Update personal and business details, understand account status (e.g., \"Verified ID\").\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, limited attention span.\nReady for handoff if: All settings are accessible without excessive scrolling,  navigation is intuitive and consistent with app standards, and all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Personal details section (with links to edit), Business details section (with links to edit),  Manage notifications setting, Change password setting, Log out option.\nSupporting:  \"Verified ID\" badge explanation,  Disable chats option, Disable Feedback option, Change language option, Change phone number, Change email.\nContextual:  Status indicators (e.g., \"Active\" for Cars45 auction access),  confirmation messages after changes are saved.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  List view of settings, similar to the reference image. Top and bottom app navigation bars included as per the user request.\n* Components:  Use existing app components for list items, navigation, and buttons. Each setting should be presented as a list item with clear labels.  Right-aligned indicators (e.g., \"Active\", \"What is it?\") should be used where applicable.\n* Styling:  Adhere to existing app styling guidelines. Maintain visual consistency with other app screens.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Navigate to sub-screens for detailed setting modifications (e.g., personal details, business details), manage notifications, change password, log out.\nSecondary Actions:  Access \"What is it?\" explanations for unclear settings.\nScreen States: Default state displaying all settings, loading state (if applicable), success state after settings are saved.\nFeedback Needs: Confirmation messages after successful updates, error messages for invalid input (if applicable), loading indicators for asynchronous operations.\n",
