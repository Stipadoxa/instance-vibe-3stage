I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The dashboard homepage uses a vertical layout.  The top section contains stats cards arranged in a horizontal layout to take advantage of screen width.  The recent activity feed follows below, also utilizing full width. Action buttons are placed below the feed. Bottom navigation is implemented at the very bottom of the screen for easy access.  Spacing between sections is 16 pixels, ensuring visual separation and readability.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The dashboard prioritizes at-a-glance information, placing key metrics (listings, views, messages) prominently at the top. Recent activity is presented chronologically below, and key actions (new listing, messages) are readily available with clear, prominent buttons. The bottom navigation ensures consistent access to other application areas.

4. **Component Choices:** For the bottom navigation, I chose the `10:4724` ("Bottom navigation") component because it is the most direct and visually consistent solution from the design system. This component offers a well-defined user interface for bottom navigation. Alternatives, such as manually creating a navigation bar using native elements, would have been less consistent with the rest of the application's visual language and would be more complex to develop and maintain.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design requires a "stats card" component to display quick metrics, but no such component was found in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.  I have addressed this gap using a combination of `native-rectangle` components for the card backgrounds and `native-text` components for numbers and labels. This workaround prioritizes visual consistency through the use of system color styles for visual communication.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:**  The visual hierarchy is established through varying text sizes (headline for numbers, body for labels) and clear spacing between sections. Stats cards are visually prominent at the top due to their positioning and size, followed by the recent activity feed and finally the action buttons.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  For the bottom navigation (`10:4724`), I have not specified a variant for the `Device` property as the design system data is not clear enough what size should be implemented here.  Further clarification is needed to choose appropriately between "Mobile" and "Tablet".

8. **Native Element Justification:** The stats cards were implemented with native elements (`native-rectangle`, `native-text`) because there is no suitable "stats card" component in the provided design system.  This approach efficiently fulfills the functional requirement of presenting key metrics while maintaining visual harmony with the overall design system.
