Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account
Secondary Goals: Create a new account, recover forgotten credentials
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions
Ready for handoff if: "Sign in" button is prominent, all fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction, error messages are clearly displayed, "Sign up" button is clearly differentiated as secondary.

Content Requirements
Critical: "Welcome" title, email field, password field, "Sign in" button
Supporting: "Sign up" button
Contextual: Error messages (incorrect credentials, empty fields), password recovery link (potentially hidden until needed for space optimization),  security notices (potentially in fine print, legal compliance).


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout optimized for mobile screens.  All elements vertically stacked.
* Components: Title ("Welcome") displayed at the top, email field with appropriate keyboard type, password field with secure input masking,  "Sign in" button (primary action, prominent styling), "Sign up" button (secondary action, less prominent styling).
* Styling:  Buttons should adhere to platform-specific design guidelines for mobile.  Consider using platform-consistent color schemes.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Sign in with email and password
Secondary Actions: Sign up, password recovery (potentially hidden/contextual)
Screen States: Default (empty fields), loading (sign-in process), error (incorrect credentials, empty fields), success (redirect to account)
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation of email format, clear error messages displayed prominently beneath the relevant field, loading indicator during authentication process.
