  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Settings management within a mobile application.\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account preferences and personal information.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates a concise and easily navigable settings screen with large touch targets due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  Users may be multitasking or in distracting environments.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal details (phone number, email, language).\nSecondary Goals:  Navigate easily between settings options, understand the impact of changes.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile device, potential for interruptions, reliance on touch input.\nReady for handoff if: All settings options are clearly listed, each option leads to a correctly functioning screen (or in-place modification), and all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction. Top app bar and bottom navigation are present and functional.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  \"Personal details\" section header, \"Change phone number\" option, \"Change email\" option, \"Change language\" option.\nSupporting:  Clear instructions or help text for each setting option.  \nContextual:  Success/failure messages after making changes, loading indicators during asynchronous operations (e.g., changing email).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n*   **Layout:** Vertical list for settings items.\n*   **Components:** Top app bar (likely containing app title or back button), list items for each setting (each item could be a button or tappable element), bottom navigation bar (with appropriate icons/labels for navigation destinations).\n*   **Styling:**  Adherence to the overall application's visual style guide.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Select a setting to change (e.g., tap \"Change phone number\").\nSecondary Actions:  Navigate to other screens via bottom navigation.\nScreen States: Default state (showing the list of settings), loading state (while making changes), success/error state (after attempting to make changes).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of which setting is selected, confirmation of successful changes, error messages for invalid input or failed changes (e.g., email already in use).\n",
