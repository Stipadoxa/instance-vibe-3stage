Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates concise design.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.
Secondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials, use convenient login options (if applicable,  this requires further investigation).
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions, potential for typos due to touch keyboard.
Ready for handoff if: Login button is clearly the most prominent element, password recovery link is visible and easily accessible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction,  error messages have designated space and are clear,  input validation (e.g., email format check) is implemented.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, login button, error message area.
Supporting: Password recovery link,  "Remember me" checkbox (consider security implications),  link to create an account.
Contextual:  Loading indicator during authentication, specific error messages for invalid credentials (e.g., "incorrect password," "invalid email").
