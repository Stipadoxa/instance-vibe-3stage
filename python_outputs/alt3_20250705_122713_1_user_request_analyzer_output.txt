Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain focused on product discovery
User Type: Mobile users browsing and searching for products across various categories.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined interface with easily accessible search and intuitive navigation; limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space; touch interaction is primary.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Search for products using keywords, browse products across different categories.
Secondary Goals: Quickly switch between product categories, potentially filter or sort search results (though not explicitly stated, it's a common e-commerce secondary goal).
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Search bar is functional and prominent within the app bar, tabs are clearly labeled and easily tappable, scrolling is smooth and responsive, and loading states are handled gracefully.

Content Requirements
Critical: Search bar, "electronics," "home goods," and "vehicles" tabs, product listings (though the specifics are not defined).
Supporting:  Potentially, a "loading" indicator while tabs load, or while the search performs.
Contextual:  Product listings will be contextual to the selected tab, and search results will be contextual to the search query.

Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** App bar containing a search bar, scrollable tabs below the app bar, scrollable product listing area below tabs.
*   **Components:** App Bar (with search bar), Scrollable Tabs ("electronics," "home goods," "vehicles"), Product Listing area (details unspecified).
*   **Styling:**  (Unspecified - to be determined based on branding guidelines).


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Perform a product search, select a product category tab.
Secondary Actions: (None explicitly specified, but could include filtering or sorting options, depending on further design choices).
Screen States: Default state (showing tabs and a potentially empty product list), loading state (while fetching data),  search results state (displaying search results).
Feedback Needs: Clear visual feedback (loading indicators) during search and tab selection, relevant error messages if data retrieval fails.
