## SECTION 1: DESIGN RATIONALE

# Design Rationale for Used Laptop Product Page

This design prioritizes clear communication of product details and facilitates easy contact with the seller, adhering strictly to the provided design system.  Mobile-first principles guide the layout, ensuring a seamless user experience on smaller screens.

### Component Intelligence Applied

* **Typography Hierarchy:** The headline uses `Headline/Large` for the product title, providing visual prominence. Section headers (e.g., "Key Information," "Specifications") utilize `Title/Large`.  Body text employs `Body/Large` for readability, while supporting details like microcopy and metadata leverage `Body/Medium` and `Caption/Small` for appropriate emphasis.  All text styles are pulled directly from the design system's text style schema.


* **Spacing System:**  The overall layout utilizes vertical `itemSpacing` of 16px between major sections for a balanced feel and improved readability.  Internal padding within components follows the design system's guidelines, ensuring consistency.  Containers use consistent padding (16px horizontal, 20px vertical) to maintain visual breathing room.


* **Component Behavior:** The `product-card` component (fallback to `list-item` if `product-card` is not available as per DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA) is employed to display product information. Its variants are adjusted based on content length (e.g., 2-line variant where necessary). The "Contact Seller" button uses the design system's `Button` component with a `Primary/primary50` background and `Size: Large` for high visual impact and clear primary action prominence. Secondary actions are implemented using `Button` component with  `Secondary/secondary50` for visual differentiation and size `Medium`. Image carousels leverage the existing image component and will be verified with a fully filled `imageUrl` property.


* **Color Application:**  The primary brand color (`Primary/primary50`) is used sparingly, primarily for CTAs and highlighting key information like price.  Neutral colors (`Neutral/neutral90` for primary text, `Neutral/neutral50` for secondary text) are extensively used for readability.  Error states, if necessary, would use semantic colors from the design system (e.g., `Error/error50`).


* **Layout Strategy:** A vertical layout prioritizes information hierarchy and mobile-first usability.  The image carousel sits prominently at the top, followed by key details, specifications, and finally, call-to-actions.


### Domain Context Integration

* **Industry Patterns:** The design follows typical e-commerce product page conventions, including a prominent product image, concise key information, detailed specifications, and clear CTAs.


* **User Mental Models:**  Users expect to see product images first, followed by pricing and essential details.  This layout mirrors the user's likely scanning patterns and mental model for product discovery.


* **Contextual Adaptations:**  The design adapts to the specific used laptop context by displaying relevant information like condition, seller rating, and specifications.


### Design System Compliance

All componentNodeIds, textStyles, and color styles are verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.  The design leverages existing components where applicable and utilizes native elements only as fallbacks for components not found in the system.

**Note:**  This JSON utilizes  `imageUrl1`, `imageUrl2`, etc. as placeholders. In a real-world scenario, these would be replaced with actual image URLs.  Also, the specifications section is partially filled.  More specifications can be added using the `component` of type  `10:10214`  following the same pattern as the provided examples.  The `Add to Wishlist` button is included as per requirement, but functionality would need to be implemented separately.  The `product-card` component is a fallback, which will need to be replaced with an actual product card component if the design system contains one.

The `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA` contains some inconsistencies (duplicate entries).  The provided JSON uses only unique color and text style entries (the first ones).  The duplicate entries in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA` should be addressed for consistency.
