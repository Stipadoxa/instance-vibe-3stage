  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving updates and information through notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of information; touch interactions require clear, large targets; interruptions are common, requiring concise and easily digestible information; location awareness may not be directly relevant to notifications.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, understand notification content (title, description), and track timestamp.\nSecondary Goals: Potentially access associated content related to the notification through implicit or explicit action.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile; need for clear visual hierarchy due to multiple notifications; potential for a large number of notifications needing efficient presentation.\nReady for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar displays user information; bottom navigation is present and functional; touch targets are appropriately sized.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the five notifications).\nSupporting:  Number of unread notifications (if applicable, shown in top bar or as a badge).\nContextual:  Indication of whether a notification has been read (e.g., visual cue).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, each notification item having a single row or a compact multi-line layout.\n* Components: Top bar (user info and potentially unread count), Notification Item (user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom navigation bar.\n* Styling: Consistent styling across all notification items; clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (by tapping on a notification item).\nSecondary Actions: Potentially mark notifications as read (implicitly or explicitly).\nScreen States: Default (showing notifications), loading state (if notifications are being fetched).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual cues for read/unread notifications; loading indicator while fetching notifications.\n",
