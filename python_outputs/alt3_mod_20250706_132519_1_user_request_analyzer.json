  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user authentication\nUser Type: SaaS application users accessing the application on mobile devices.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a quick and secure login process with a touch-friendly interface, considering limited screen real estate and potential for interruptions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the SaaS application.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is prominent, password recovery link is clearly visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and \"Forgot Password?\" text is center-aligned.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, login button, \"Forgot Password?\" link.\nSupporting:  None specified in original request or modification.\nContextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials), loading indicators (during authentication).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* **Layout:** Vertical layout for login form elements.  \"Username Input Container\" and \"Password Input Container\" are vertically oriented with labels above input fields.  The \"Forgot Password?\" text is positioned below the login button.\n* **Components:** Username/email text input (Filled, enabled), Password text input (Filled, enabled), Login button (Android+Web, Large, Filled, Default, Green), \"Forgot Password?\" text.\n* **Styling:**  Login button is green.  No other styling explicitly defined beyond component types.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials.\nSecondary Actions: Access password recovery.\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (implied), error state (implied).\nFeedback Needs: Clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.\n\n\n**Analysis of Modification Request:**\n\nThe modification request is a `Detailed Specification` focusing solely on the alignment of the \"Forgot Password?\" text.  The existing design and functionality should be preserved.  The only change required is to center-align the \"Forgot Password?\" text within its existing container or the screen itself, depending on the current implementation.  This is a simple visual adjustment that does not impact functionality or user flow.\n",
