The design should balance visual appeal to encourage purchase ('impress') with clear information and a smooth user flow ('convert'). Therefore, an 'enhanced' treatment using design system components with selective native enhancements (e.g., high-quality image treatments, creative use of whitespace) is recommended.  Overly expressive design could distract from the key call to action."
