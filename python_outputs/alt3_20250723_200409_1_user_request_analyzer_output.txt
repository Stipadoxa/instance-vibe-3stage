Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain for mobile application access
User Type: Mobile app users attempting to access their accounts.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined, touch-friendly interface with minimal steps to login.  They may be in distracting environments and have varying network conditions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Securely authenticate and access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for convenient access; recover forgotten credentials.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate; touch-only interaction; potential for interruptions; varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements (buttons, fields) meet minimum touch target sizes;  error messages are clearly displayed; password recovery and T&C are accessible; social login buttons are clearly visible and functional.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field; password field; primary login button;  password recovery link; terms and conditions acceptance footnote.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google).
Contextual: Error messages (invalid credentials, network issues); loading indicators.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical layout, placing fields and buttons in a logical sequence (fields at the top, then primary login button, then social login, then links).
* Components:  Two input fields (username/email, password); primary "Login" button; secondary social media login buttons;  "Forgot Password" link;  footnote acknowledging acceptance of terms and conditions.
* Styling:  Consistent with provided visual reference (image), ensuring visual hierarchy prioritizes the main login button.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login via username/password; login via social media.
Secondary Actions: Initiate password recovery.
Screen States: Default state; loading state; error state (incorrect credentials, network error); success state (redirects to app).
Feedback Needs: Clear error messages for invalid inputs and login failures;  visual feedback for button presses and loading progress.
