## SECTION 1: DESIGN RATIONALE

# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied

- **Typography Hierarchy**: The seller information row utilizes a clear typography hierarchy. The seller's name is styled with `Title/Medium` (16px, Roboto Medium) for prominence, while the rating is set in `Body/Medium` (14px, Roboto Regular) for secondary importance.  This ensures readability and visual distinction between primary and supporting information.

- **Spacing System**:  The `list-item` component's built-in `internalPadding` (12px top/bottom, 16px left/right) provides sufficient spacing around the content.  Additional spacing between the avatar and text is achieved through the horizontal layout container's `itemSpacing` of 8px, which creates a visually comfortable separation without feeling overly spaced.

- **Component Behavior**: The `list-item` component is selected due to its inherent support for leading and trailing elements, and its ability to handle one or two lines of text. The avatar is placed as the leading element. The seller name and rating are placed in the primary `Headline` area. This leverages the built-in structure of the `list-item` for optimal efficiency and consistency with the design system.  No visibility overrides or icon swaps are necessary at this row level.

- **Color Application**: The seller name uses `Neutral/neutral90` (#304049) for optimal contrast against the `White/white100` (#ffffff) background of the `list-item` component. The rating stars utilize the `Primary/primary50` color (#00b53f) for visual emphasis and brand consistency.  All color choices are directly referenced from the `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA` using their exact names.

- **Layout Strategy**: A `HORIZONTAL` `layoutContainer` is used to arrange the avatar and text elements. This is nested within a `VERTICAL` `layoutContainer` which is a child of the main content container, respecting the mandatory three-container mobile architecture.  The `HORIZONTAL` container's `itemSpacing` manages horizontal spacing. The `primaryAxisSizingMode` for the `HORIZONTAL` container is set to `AUTO` to allow it to dynamically adjust its height based on the content. This ensures that the row height remains compact and efficient within the list.


## Domain Context Integration

- **Industry Patterns**: The design mimics common e-commerce patterns by using a concise list to display sellers. The prominent avatar and rating provide a quick visual cue for user decision making. The primary action (tapping the row to view the seller's profile) is intuitive and aligns with user expectations.

- **User Mental Models**:  Users are accustomed to seeing seller profiles in lists with avatars and ratings. The layout is designed to support this mental model for ease of navigation and interaction.

- **Contextual Adaptations**: The `list-item` component is a general-purpose element, and no significant modifications are required to adapt it to this specific context.


## Design System Compliance

- **Component Verification**: All componentNodeIds used (if any) are validated against the `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.
- **Variant Completeness**: The `list-item` component is used with appropriate variants to handle the image and text content.
- **Text Property Mapping**: The text content (`Seller Name` and `Seller Rating`) is mapped accurately to the corresponding `textLayers` of the `list-item` component, in this case `"Headline"` and `"Supporting text"`.
- **Schema Adherence**: The JSON specification adheres strictly to the structure and properties defined in the `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA` schema.
