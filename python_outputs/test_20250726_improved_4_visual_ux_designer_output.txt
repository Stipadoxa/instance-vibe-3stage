**Note:**  This response assumes the existence of a `notification-item` component type within the design system, along with variants for `trailing` (allowing a badge),  `badgeText`, and icon properties. The specific component IDs and property names would need to be adjusted to match the actual design system data.  The `improvedLayoutData` provides a structural improvement by separating the badge from the main text, addressing the scannability issue.  The placeholder subtitle "subtitle" is removed as it's not informative.  Additional improvements may be needed depending on the actual design system provided.
