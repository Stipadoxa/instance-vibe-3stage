  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile application access.\nUser Type: Mobile application users attempting to log in to their accounts.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a simple, secure, and touch-friendly login experience with clear visual hierarchy and minimal input.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of critical information.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Securely authenticate and access the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Use social media login options for faster access; recover forgotten passwords.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for distractions, variable network connectivity.\nReady for handoff if: All interactive elements have sufficient tap targets (48dp minimum); clear visual hierarchy prioritizes the primary action (login button);  error states are clearly defined and communicated; password recovery and T&C are clearly accessible and appropriately sized.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), password recovery link.\nContextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials, etc.), success message (upon successful login).  Terms & Conditions footnote.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column layout to optimize for vertical scrolling on mobile.\n* Components:  Input fields (username/email and password), a primary “Login” button styled as a prominent call-to-action, secondary buttons for social media login (e.g., Facebook, Google), a link to password recovery, a footnote regarding acceptance of terms and conditions.\n* Styling: Refer to the provided visual reference for styling guidelines regarding color schemes, typography, and spacing.  Ensure consistency with the application's existing design system.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login using credentials, login with social media account.\nSecondary Actions: Password recovery, access Terms & Conditions.\nScreen States: Default (initial state), loading (while authenticating), error (invalid credentials or other issues), success (upon successful login).\nFeedback Needs: Clear and concise error messages below respective fields; visual cues to indicate loading/processing; visual confirmation of successful login (e.g., navigation to the app's home screen).\n",
