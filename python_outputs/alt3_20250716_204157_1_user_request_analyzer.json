  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management\nUser Type: Mobile app users managing their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a streamlined settings page with clear grouping, concise information, and easy navigation using touch interactions.  Screen real estate is limited.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage notification preferences, review account status.\nSecondary Goals: Understand account status (e.g., \"Verified ID\"), easily access help/support information.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for distractions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All settings are accessible, grouped logically, top and bottom navigation is present and functional, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.  All content from the reference image is included, using existing app components.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (section with modifiable fields), business details (section with modifiable fields), access to Cars45 auction (toggle switch), \"Verified ID\" badge (status indicator with explanation link), change phone number, change email, change language, disable chats (toggle switch), disable feedback (toggle switch), manage notifications, change password, delete my account permanently, log out.\nSupporting: \"What is it?\" link for \"Verified ID\" badge explanation.\nContextual:  Error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., new password doesn't meet requirements), success messages after changes are saved.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column list of settings, grouped into sections with headers (Personal details, Business details, etc.). Top and bottom app navigation bars are present.\n* Components: Use existing app components for list items, toggle switches, buttons, etc.  Each setting should have a clear label.  \"What is it?\" links should use a standard hyperlink component.\n* Styling: Adhere to the existing app's color scheme and styling guidelines as shown in the reference image.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Access and modify individual settings.\nSecondary Actions: Access help information (\"What is it?\").\nScreen States: Default state (all settings displayed), loading state (while saving changes), error state (invalid input), success state (after successful change).\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indicators for active/inactive settings (e.g., toggle switches), loading indicators during saving, error messages for invalid inputs, confirmation messages after successful changes.\n",
