## DESIGN RATIONALE

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.  All component IDs used are present in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure for mobile-first design. The app bar occupies the top section, followed by a search bar, a filter button, and then a grid of product cards.  Consistent 16px padding is used for main content sections to ensure comfortable spacing.  The grid of product cards utilizes horizontal wrapping within a container to optimize space usage on different screen sizes.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first encounters the app bar providing site navigation, then the search bar to input their query, followed by a filter button to refine results. Lastly, the grid of product cards provides a visually appealing and efficient way to browse the results.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `appbar` (10:5620) component for the top bar because it provides a pre-built structure for common navigation and title elements.  This is more efficient than building a custom header with native elements.  The `product card` (147:3743) component is used for its integrated image, title, price, and rating displays. This component streamlines implementation compared to creating individual elements.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for creating star ratings.  I've implemented a workaround using five individual `icon/star` (635:4752) components, which will be programmatically controlled to display the correct number of filled stars representing the seller rating.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The app bar maintains a consistent visual presence across the screen. The search bar is prominently featured below the app bar. Product cards are then displayed in a clearly defined grid layout.  Typography is used for hierarchy; headlines are used for titles, and body text for descriptions and prices.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `appbar` (10:5620) component, I selected the "search-field" variant in the "Type" category to integrate the search functionality directly into the app bar. The "Default" variant is used for the Filter button, providing a clear and simple call-to-action. For the `product card` component (147:3743) the `grid` view was selected.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  Product images are displayed using `native-rectangle` with `fill: {type: "IMAGE", scaleMode: "FILL"}` because the design system's image components either are not verified or do not directly support image placeholders with this functionality.
