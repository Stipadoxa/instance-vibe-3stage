Domain & Context
Domain:  Unspecified domain; modification request on an existing mobile application.  The original design intent is unknown beyond the presence of a JSON object `{"test": true}` which suggests a very basic application or a test environment.
User Type: Mobile users interacting with a simple application.
Platform Impact: Mobile users require a simple, intuitive interface with clear touch targets and minimal steps.  Screen real estate is limited.


User Requirements
Primary Goals:  Interact with the application's core functionality (currently unknown but implied by the original `{"test": true}` JSON). Add a button to the existing interface.
Secondary Goals: The addition of the button should maintain ease of use and not disrupt the existing functionality.  The purpose of the button itself is undefined.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate on a mobile device;  the button must integrate seamlessly without disrupting the existing, currently unknown, layout.
Ready for handoff if: The new button is visually distinct, has appropriate touch target size, and does not overlap or obscure existing elements.  Functionality of the button is defined and implemented.


Content Requirements
Critical:  The existing JSON data `{"test": true}` (or its visual representation) must be retained.  A new button element must be added.
Supporting:  Any supporting content depends entirely on the intended functionality of the new button.
Contextual:  None specified, depends on button functionality.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: The existing layout (currently unknown) must be preserved. The button's placement within the layout needs to be specified.
* Components: Add a new button component.  Specifications regarding the button's appearance (text, icon, style) are needed.
* Styling:  Button styling (color, shape, size, etc.) needs to be defined to maintain consistency with the existing (unknown) design.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Interact with existing functionality (undefined) and the new button.
Secondary Actions:  None specified beyond those already present.
Screen States:  Additional states might be needed depending on the button's functionality (e.g., loading state, success state, error state).
Feedback Needs: Visual feedback for button presses (e.g., change in color or appearance) is necessary.
