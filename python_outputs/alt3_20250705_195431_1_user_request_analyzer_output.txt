Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain specifically a marketplace app with product discovery
User Type: Mobile users browsing and filtering products within a marketplace app.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and efficient search results page with easy-to-use filters due to screen size limitations and touch interaction.  Results should load quickly to avoid user frustration. Location awareness could be used to filter by proximity.


User Requirements
Primary Goals: View relevant search results, refine search results using filters.
Secondary Goals: Sort results by relevance, price, or other criteria; view product details quickly; navigate to product pages.
User Constraints: Small screen size limits the number of results and filter options displayed at once; touch-based interaction requires large, easily tappable elements; users may have slow or unreliable network connections.
Ready for handoff if:  Filter chips are clearly visible and easily selectable; search results are displayed in a visually appealing and easily scannable format; loading indicators are present for network requests;  minimum tappable areas meet mobile design standards; and pagination/infinite scrolling is implemented smoothly.


Content Requirements
Critical: Search results (product images, titles, prices); filter chips (categories, price range, etc.); pagination or infinite scrolling;  indication of total number of results.
Supporting:  Sorting options (e.g., relevance, price, newest);  product ratings and reviews (summary or count);  distance filtering (if location-aware).
Contextual:  "No results found" message; loading indicator; error messages for network issues; filter chip selection states.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  List or grid layout for search results, clearly separated from filter chips (perhaps above or below).
* Components: Filter chips (using Material Design or similar guidelines for consistent visual language), Product cards (image, title, price, rating summary), pagination/infinite scroll component, clear heading indicating search query.
* Styling:  Use of brand colors and typography; clear visual hierarchy to prioritize important information.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Selecting filter chips, tapping on a product to view details.
Secondary Actions: Sorting results, navigating to next/previous pages.
Screen States:  Default state (showing initial results); loading state (while fetching results/applying filters); "no results" state; error state (network issues).
Feedback Needs: Visual feedback when a filter chip is selected; loading indicators for network requests; clear error messages with actionable steps.
