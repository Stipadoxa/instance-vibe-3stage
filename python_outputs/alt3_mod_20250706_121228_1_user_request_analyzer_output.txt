**Modification Analysis:**

The modification request is a `Detailed Specification` focusing on a precise visual change.  The core functionality remains the same. The only change needed is to alter the horizontal alignment of the "Forgot Password?" text from left to center alignment.  No changes to the existing layout, components, or styling (except for the specified text alignment) are required.
