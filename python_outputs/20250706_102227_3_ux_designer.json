  "content": "## Information Architecture Specification:  My Awesome Mobile App\n\nThis specification outlines the information architecture for \"My Awesome Mobile App,\" focusing on content structure and functional requirements, independent of any specific design system.  The goal is to provide a flexible framework adaptable to Material Design, iOS Human Interface Guidelines, or custom design systems.\n\n**Screen Architecture**\n\n**Layout Structure:**\nScreen Pattern: Hub-and-Spoke (central hub screen with links to other features)\nNavigation Flow: Tab-based sections (bottom navigation bar)\nContent Organization: Fixed header + scrollable content\n\n**Mobile Framework:**\nPrimary Interactions: Touch-based, tap interactions, swipe gestures for navigation where appropriate.  Thumb zone priority for primary actions in the bottom third of the screen.\nContent Prioritization:  Critical information (e.g., account balance, urgent notifications) at the top of the screen.  Less critical information revealed through scrolling.\nAction Accessibility: Primary actions are placed within the thumb zone.  Secondary actions are accessible but not prioritized.\n\n\n**Content Requirements**\n\n**1. Account Overview (Priority: Critical)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Account balance, user name, profile picture\nSecondary Content: Recent transactions summary, available credit\nMetadata: Last updated timestamp\nInteractive Elements: Tap profile picture to edit profile, tap transaction summary to view details\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Fixed header, scrollable content, status indication (e.g., low balance warning)\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, swipe to refresh\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for details, single-line for balance.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: Card with header (profile picture and name), body (balance, summary), and trailing metadata (timestamp).\nAlternative Approaches:  List with separate sections for balance, summary, and metadata.\nContent Mapping: Title  \"header text\", Balance  \"primary text\", Summary  \"supporting text\", Timestamp  \"metadata text\"\nMobile Considerations: Large, clear display of balance; sufficient touch target for profile picture.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** account, balance, profile, transaction, status\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: High\nFallback Guidance: If a card component isn't available, use a combination of native text views and image views to achieve a similar layout.\n\n\n**2. Transactions (Priority: High)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Transaction date, description, amount\nSecondary Content: Transaction type (debit/credit), merchant (if applicable)\nMetadata: None\nInteractive Elements: Tap a transaction to view details\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Scrollable list, filtering options (date range, type)\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, pull-to-refresh\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for description, single-line for date, amount, type.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: List item with leading element (date), primary text (description), and trailing text (amount).\nAlternative Approaches: Card list, table view.\nContent Mapping: Date  \"leading text\", Description  \"primary text\", Amount  \"trailing text\"\nMobile Considerations:  Clear visual separation between transactions; efficient scrolling behavior.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** transaction, list, item, date, amount, filter\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: Medium\nFallback Guidance:  If a standard list item isn't available, a native table view can be used.\n\n\n**3. Settings (Priority: Medium)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Setting name (e.g., Notifications, Security)\nSecondary Content: Brief description of each setting\nMetadata: On/Off switch or other status indicator (where applicable)\nInteractive Elements: Tap a setting to configure it\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Scrollable list, on/off switches, segmented controls (if needed)\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, toggle switches\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for descriptions, single-line for setting names.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: List item with leading text (setting name), trailing text (brief description), and trailing switch/indicator.\nAlternative Approaches:  Simple card list, segmented controls for certain settings.\nContent Mapping:  Name  \"primary text\", Description  \"secondary text\", Status  \"trailing switch\"\nMobile Considerations:  Clearly labeled settings; sufficient space for toggles and descriptions.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** settings, list, item, switch, toggle, configuration\n\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: Medium\nFallback Guidance: If design system switches are unavailable, native switch controls may be used.\n\n\n**4. Notifications (Priority: High)**\n\n**Content Structure:**\nPrimary Content: Notification message\nSecondary Content: Timestamp, sender (if applicable)\nMetadata: Read/Unread status\nInteractive Elements: Tap notification to view details, swipe to dismiss\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nDisplay Capability: Scrollable list, status indication (read/unread), swipe actions.\nInteraction Patterns: Tap to navigate, swipe to dismiss\nContent Adaptation: Multi-line for message, single-line for timestamp and sender.\n\n**Implementation Options:**\nPrimary Approach: List item with leading icon (read/unread), primary text (message), and trailing text (timestamp).\nAlternative Approaches:  Card-based notifications\nContent Mapping: Message  \"primary text\", Timestamp  \"secondary text\", Read status  \"leading icon\"\nMobile Considerations:  Clear visual cues for unread notifications; efficient swipe-to-dismiss.\n\n**Semantic Keywords:** notification, message, list, item, status, unread\n\n**Component Fallback Strategy:**\nDesign System Priority: Medium\nFallback Guidance: If a specialized notification component is unavailable, use a standard list item with appropriate styling.\n\n\n\n**Navigation Architecture**\n\n**Inter-Section Navigation:**\nFlow Pattern: Bottom navigation bar for easy switching between sections.\nEntry Mechanisms:  Tab bar at the bottom of the screen.\nContext Preservation:  Context is generally not preserved between sections; each section functions independently.\n\n\n**Intra-Section Navigation:**\nContent Discovery:  Scrolling, filtering (where applicable).\nTask Completion:  Primary actions are clearly indicated within each section.\n\n\n**Implementation Guidance**\n\n**Content-to-Component Mapping:**\n(Examples provided above in each functional area)\n\n\n**Mobile Optimization Patterns:**\nTouch Target Requirements: Minimum 44px for interactive elements, larger for primary actions (e.g., buttons).\nThumb Navigation Zones: Primary actions placed in the bottom third of the screen. Secondary actions higher up.\nContent Scaling: Content adapts to different screen sizes through flexible layouts and responsive text sizing.\n\n\n**Design System Flexibility:**\n(Guidance provided above in each functional area, emphasizing flexibility)\n\n\n\n**Success Validation**\n\n(Success criteria outlined in the original brief are addressed within this specification through the focus on flexible implementation and mobile-first design principles.)\n",
