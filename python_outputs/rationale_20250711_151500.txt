üìù Original User Request:
create product card with image, title, price, and buy button

üìã Analyzed Requirements:
User Requirements
Primary Goals: Quickly view product details (image, title, price), initiate purchase.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially view product ratings/reviews (if space allows), access additional product information (e.g., via a "details" link).
User Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during browsing.
Ready for handoff if:  Image is prominent, title is clear and concise, price is easily readable, "Buy" button is large and clearly distinguishable, and all elements have sufficient tappable areas.

üé® Designer Rationale:
{
  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout uses a single vertical column to maximize screen real estate on mobile devices.  Elements are stacked vertically, prioritizing the most important information (image, title, price, button) at the top. Spacing between elements is consistent (24px) to maintain visual clarity and breathability.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user flow is designed to be as streamlined as possible for mobile shoppers.  The prominent product image immediately attracts attention.  The title and price provide essential information at a glance. The large \"Buy\" button ensures a clear and easy path to purchase.  Additional information can be accessed via a potential \"View Details\" link.",
    "componentChoices": "The `IMAGES` component is used for the product image, allowing for responsive sizing.  The `text` component is used for the title and price, styled with appropriate text styles to ensure readability and hierarchy. A `Button` component (Large size, Green color variant) is used for the primary \"Buy\" action. This ensures a clear call-to-action.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Visual hierarchy is achieved through size and placement. The product image is the largest element, immediately capturing the user's attention. The title is larger than the price, and both are styled with appropriate text styles and color styles to create prominence.  The \"Buy\" button uses a distinct color (Green Primary) to stand out. Spacing between elements further emphasizes the hierarchy."
  }

üîß Engineer Rationale:
{
  "implementationRationale": {
    "componentSelection": "Component IDs 10:7816 (image), 10:3907 (button) are used as provided in the input.  Native text components are used for the title and price, as no specific component IDs were provided for these elements.",
    "styleApplication": "Text styles ('Title/Medium', 'Title/Small') and color styles ('Neutral/neutral90', 'Primary/primary50') are applied as specified in the input to maintain design consistency.  No modifications were made to these styles.",
    "designSystemMapping": "The input directly maps to the Figma design system.  Text styles, color styles, and component IDs are used without changes. The image component is used for the product image, and the native-text component is used for the text elements.",
    "variantDecisions": "The button component uses variants 'Size: Large', 'Type: Filled', 'Color: Green', and 'State: Default' as specified in the input.  The image component uses the variant 'Type: 1 image'. These variants are preserved to match the designer's specifications."
