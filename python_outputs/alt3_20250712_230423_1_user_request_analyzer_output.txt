Secondary Goals:  Easily log out of the application.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate on mobile devices, reliance on touch interaction, potential for interruptions during use.
Ready for handoff if: All settings options are clearly presented, top app bar and bottom navigation are implemented correctly,  touch targets are appropriately sized, and all actions result in clear visual feedback.


Content Requirements
Critical: Personal details section (displaying current information), "Change phone number" option, "Change email" option, "Change language" option, "Delete my account permanently" option, "Log out" option.
Supporting:  Clear indication of currently selected language.
Contextual:  Confirmation dialog before account deletion.
