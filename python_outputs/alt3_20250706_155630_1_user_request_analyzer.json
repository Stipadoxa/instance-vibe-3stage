  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Generic UI element within a mobile application.  The context is unclear and requires further clarification.\nUser Type: Mobile application users interacting with a button.  Specific user personas and their tasks are undefined.\nPlatform Impact: The mobile platform necessitates consideration of touch interaction, limited screen real estate, and potentially varying screen sizes and resolutions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Trigger a specific action within the application by interacting with the button.  The exact action is currently unknown and needs definition.\nSecondary Goals:  Provide clear visual feedback to the user upon interaction.  This may include visual changes to the button itself (e.g., highlighting, changing color) or other forms of visual cues indicating the action's status.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch interaction, potential for accidental taps due to finger size, varying user dexterity.\nReady for handoff if: The button is appropriately sized for touch interaction (minimum tappable area defined), its function is clearly indicated visually (via icon or text), and visual feedback upon interaction is implemented.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  Button label (text or icon) clearly indicating the action.\nSupporting: None,  but may become relevant once the specific button function is defined.\nContextual:  Disabled state styling if the button becomes unavailable under certain conditions.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  The button's placement requires further specification.\n* Components:  A single button element.  The style of the button (e.g., shape, color) is to be determined.\n* Styling:  The button style (shape, color, etc.) needs further definition.  Consider standard mobile UI conventions for button styling.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Tap/press the button to initiate a specific action.\nSecondary Actions: None at this stage.\nScreen States: Default (enabled) and disabled states. Additional states may be needed depending on the button function (e.g., loading state).\nFeedback Needs: Visual feedback upon tap/press (e.g., highlight, change color).  Feedback on the result of the button action (e.g., success/failure message).\n",
