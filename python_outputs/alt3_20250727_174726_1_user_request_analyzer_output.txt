Domain & Context
Domain:  Communication/Information Delivery within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users who need to view and manage their notifications.
Platform Impact:  Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information display.  Touch interaction requires clear, large tap targets.  The design must be easily navigable and understandable within short, interrupted interaction periods.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals:  Potentially dismiss notifications (archive/mark as read). Navigate to related content from within the notification.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if: All five notification items are clearly displayed, user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are visible for each, top bar user info is present and clear, bottom navigation is functional and uncluttered.  Tap targets meet accessibility guidelines.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp for each of the five notifications, user information in the top bar.
Supporting:  Indicator for unread notifications (if applicable),  a count of total notifications (if exceeding the displayed five).
Contextual:  Potentially different visual indicators based on notification type (e.g., a different icon for system alerts versus user messages).  Option to dismiss notifications (if applicable).

Structural & Component Directives
*   Layout: Vertical list of 5 notifications.
*   Components: Top bar (User info, potentially notification count), Notification Item (User avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom navigation bar.
*   Styling:  (No specific styling directives provided in the user request.)

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details (tapping a notification item).
Secondary Actions: Dismiss/archive notifications (if applicable), navigate to the screen linked to the notification (if applicable).
Screen States:  Default state (showing 5 notifications),  potentially a state indicating no notifications. Empty state design should be considered.
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback on which notification is currently selected (if applicable) or has been dismissed.
