  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates concise display of information, use of touch interactions, and consideration of limited screen real estate.  The design must be easily scannable and accommodate interruptions.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View a list of recent notifications, understand the content of each notification.\nSecondary Goals: Quickly assess the importance of each notification, potentially take action based on notification content (though actions are not specified in the request).\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch interactions, potential for interruptions, variable network conditions affecting loading times.\nReady for handoff if:  Five notification items are displayed correctly, each with user avatar, title, description, and timestamp. Top bar with user info and bottom navigation are present.  All elements are appropriately sized and spaced for touch interaction.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the five notifications), user information in the top bar.\nSupporting:  None explicitly specified in the request.  Potentially, a \"mark as read\" indicator or similar interaction could be considered supporting content.\nContextual:  Potentially a \"load more\" indicator if more than five notifications exist.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical list for notifications.  Top bar at the top of the screen. Bottom navigation at the bottom of the screen.\n* Components: Top bar (containing user info, potentially a title indicating \"Notifications\"), Notification list items (each containing user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom navigation bar (containing several tabs/buttons).\n* Styling:  No specific styling requirements provided.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (likely by tapping a notification item).\nSecondary Actions:  Potentially actions within each notification item (not specified), navigation via bottom navigation bar.\nScreen States:  Default (showing 5 notifications), potentially a loading state if fetching notifications, potentially an empty state if no notifications exist.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual distinction between read and unread notifications (if applicable).  Loading indicators if content is dynamically loaded.\n",
