I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs referenced below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical scrolling structure.  Each notification type is presented as a separate `list-item` component, providing a clear visual separation and allowing for easy toggling.  The item spacing is set to 8dp for visual breathing room between settings.  No padding is applied to the root container to allow the content to span edge-to-edge.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user can easily scan the list of notification types, understand their purpose from the descriptive text, and toggle them on or off with a single tap. This flow is straightforward and aligns with standard settings page interactions.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `list-item` (ID: `10:10214`) component for each notification setting.  It's superior to using a `native-rectangle` (which would require more manual styling and layout) and a `filter-chip` (which implies categorization rather than simple on/off settings) because it provides built-in support for leading and trailing elements (the toggle switch and descriptive text).  The `switch` component is used to enable and disable notifications.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "notification settings" component. A combination of existing components (`list-item` and `switch`) effectively replicates the needed functionality.  This approach ensures consistency with the rest of the application's design while addressing the specific user requirement.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through the consistent use of the `list-item` component and its pre-defined text styles.  The headline text for each item uses a prominent style, while the toggle switch and supplementary text are less prominent.   A divider is used between items for improved readability.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the `list-item` component, I've selected the following variants: `Condition: 2-line`, `Leading: Switch`, `Trailing: None`, `Show overline: False`, `Show supporting text: True`.  This allows two lines for notification descriptions and a `switch` to control the on/off state for each notification.  `Trailing: None` as we can use the `list-item` component to place the text next to the switch. `Show overline: False` as we don't need any additional labels above the notification type.

8. **Native Element Justification:** None. All functionality was successfully implemented using the available components.
