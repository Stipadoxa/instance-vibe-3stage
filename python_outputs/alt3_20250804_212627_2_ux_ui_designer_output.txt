**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout utilizes a vertical layout mode for a clear top-to-bottom flow.  The top section features a full-width hero image area using a native-rectangle to accommodate multiple product photos. This is followed by sections for the product title, price, condition, seller profile (including rating), and product description, each separated by dividers (`10:8459`) for visual clarity.  Each section is given appropriate padding for readability and visual breathing room.  Horizontal sizing is managed to ensure the title and description (`native-text`) fill the available width.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user journey starts with visually appealing product images, immediately followed by essential information (title, price, condition).  Then, seller credibility (profile and rating) and detailed description are presented before a clear call to action ("Contact Seller").  This prioritized information delivery supports a quick and informative user experience.

4. **Component Choices:**  I chose `10:7816` (IMAGES) for displaying multiple product photos (although it requires image placeholder for this prototype). I considered using multiple `native-rectangle` elements for each image, but `10:7816` is semantically more appropriate given its designed purpose. I also considered the `147:3743` (product card), but it wasn't suitable for the full-width hero image layout requirement. `10:3907` (Button) is used for "Contact Seller" for its clear visual and interaction pattern.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying a hero image gallery.  To address this, I used a `native-rectangle` with an image fill to create a full-width image placeholder and accommodate multiple product images in a visually appealing manner. This provides a flexible solution to meet the visual requirements of the product detail page while adhering to the design system's style guidelines for image placeholders.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through element sizing, spacing, and typography.  The large, full-width hero image establishes immediate visual dominance.  The product title and price are prominently displayed using larger text styles, while other details are presented in a secondary or tertiary text hierarchy.  Dividers further segment the content for clarity.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  The "Contact Seller" button (`10:3907`) uses the "Filled", "Medium", and "Green" variants to provide a clear and visually prominent call-to-action. The filled style is more visually assertive than the outlined styles, increasing the likelihood of users noticing it.  Medium size offers comfortable tap area on mobile.

8. **Native Element Justification:** The design system lacks a single component that manages a full-width hero image gallery.  Native `native-rectangle` elements provide the required flexibility to accommodate multiple images in a full-width layout, which is critical for achieving an impactful visual design.
