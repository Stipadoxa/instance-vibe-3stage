{
  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout is organized vertically, prioritizing visual hierarchy.  The hero section (product images) dominates the top, followed by key product details (title, price), seller information (avatar, name, location), and finally a prominent call-to-action button.  Spacing between sections is consistent with the design system's default spacing guidelines.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user flow is designed to provide quick access to key information and a clear path to contact the seller.  Prominent visual cues guide the user's eye down the screen, emphasizing essential details and facilitating a smooth user experience. The prominent 'Contact Seller' button is positioned at the end to encourage user interaction after they've reviewed product and seller details.",
    "componentChoices": "I chose the 'Button' component (10:3907) over the 'chip' component (10:8132) and the 'snackbar' component (10:3856) because it provides a clear, unambiguous call-to-action that aligns well with the 'Convert' emotional intent. The chip component lacks the visual prominence required for a high-impact CTA, and the snackbar component is inappropriate for this context.  The reference shows a large, primary colored button is used in the UI to highlight high impact actions.",
    "componentGaps": "User request requires an image carousel, but the design system lacks this component. I created a carousel-like experience using auto-layout horizontal scroll with multiple 'image' components (10:7816). This allows multiple product photos while maintaining semantic meaning and functionality.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Visual hierarchy is established through a combination of design system components and native elements. The hero section uses larger typography and a full-width image to command attention.  Subsequent sections use progressively smaller typography and spacing to create a natural visual flow.",
    "variantSelectionRationale": "I chose the 'Large' size for the 'Contact Seller' button (10:3907) instead of 'Medium' and 'Small' because it provides optimal tap target size on mobile, improving usability. The reference shows that larger buttons are used for critical actions and better accessibility. The 'Filled' button type was selected over 'Outlined' and 'Text' to improve visual prominence and ensure clear actionability.",
    "nativeElementJustification": "With moment significance of 0.7 and 'Decision Points' user journey position, this product detail screen warrants enhanced treatment. A native-rectangle background with a subtle gradient adds visual interest and enhances memorability, aligning with the 'impress' emotional intent.  The native background complements the existing design system components rather than altering core functionality."
