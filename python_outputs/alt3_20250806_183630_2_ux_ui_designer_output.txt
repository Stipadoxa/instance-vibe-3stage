SECTIONS:
1. header: Contains the search bar (10:12086) and a title displaying "Search Results for "Electronics"" (native-text) and the number of results (native-text).  This provides immediate context and allows users to refine their search.
2. filters: Includes the filter button (10:3907), activating a filter modal. This section enables users to refine search results based on specific criteria.
3. results: A grid layout (layoutContainer, layoutWrap: "WRAP") of product cards (147:3743), each displaying product images (native-rectangle with image fill), titles (native-text), prices (native-text), and seller ratings (using star icons from 635:4752). This is the core of the page, presenting the search results in an easily scannable format.

DESIGN RATIONALE:
1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.
2. **Section Planning:** The section blueprint follows the "Listing" page type pattern: header, filters, results. The header provides immediate context, filters allow for refinement, and the results section showcases the product listings.  This structure meets user needs by providing a clear path to finding desired products.
3. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical stacking of sections.  The header is a full-width element at the top. The filters section is also full-width to make it prominent. The results section uses a horizontal wrap layout (layoutContainer with layoutWrap: "WRAP") for product cards to create a grid layout that optimizes screen space on mobile. Level 1 containers (header, filters, and results) use `horizontalSizing: "FILL"` for full width.  Spacing between sections and grid items is handled through the appropriate padding and `itemSpacing` properties within layout containers.  The root container uses `itemSpacing: 0` and `padding: 0` per API requirements.
4. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first sees the search results and can directly interact with the products. The filter button provides an option to narrow the selection, and the implicit "View More Results" will be achieved through pagination (which is not defined in the system, and thus no component could be selected).
5. **Component Choices:**
    - I chose the `search-field` component (10:12086) for the search bar because it's a dedicated search component from the design system, offering a user-friendly experience. I considered using a `text input` (10:8492) component, but that lacked the visual affordance associated with search specifically. A native text input would have been a poor alternative, missing visual cues for the users.
    - I chose the `Button` component (10:3907) for the filter button because it is a standard button component, and its styling is consistent with the design system.  The alternatives were not appropriate because a `snackbar` (10:3856) component is designed for feedback, not actions, and there was no alternative button available in the design system.
    - I chose the `product card` component (147:3743) for product listings because this is the most appropriate component from the Design System, allowing me to display images, titles, pricing and seller rating.  There was no appropriate alternative component for this need.
6. **Component Gaps:** The user request includes pagination ("View More Results"), which requires a component for handling the loading of additional product results in a paginated format.  This is not included in DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA.  Thus, I will be using native components for pagination in the event of future development, after this MVP.
7. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through section placement and component size. The search bar is prominent at the top. The filter button is clearly visible. The product cards are displayed in a grid and given more visual weight to direct the user's attention.
8. **Variant Selection Rationale:**
    - For the `search-field` (10:12086), I chose the `State: default` variant because it's the initial state, aligning with the user's expectation when loading the page.  
    - For the `Button` (10:3907) I chose `Platform: Android+Web`, `Size: Medium`, `Type: Filled`, `State: Default`, and `Color: Green`.  Given the context of a filter button, these were the most appropriate choices based on standard UX design patterns. Other states and sizes were not necessary for this MVP.
    - For the `product card` (147:3743), I chose `view: grid` and `type: normal` for the display of the products in a grid format.
9. **Native Element Justification:**  Pagination functionality is needed to load more products. This functionality is missing from the provided design system components.  Therefore, I will use a `native-text` component for the "View More Results" action.  This maintains component-based interactions for other elements while addressing the missing functionality with a native element.
