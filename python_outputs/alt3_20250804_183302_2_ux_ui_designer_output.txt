**DESIGN RATIONALE**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:** I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The profile page uses a vertical layout (`layoutMode`: "VERTICAL") for a clear top-to-bottom flow of information.  Sections are separated by dividers (`10:8459`) for visual clarity.  Each input field occupies the full width of its container using `"horizontalSizing": "FILL"` to optimize screen space on both mobile and desktop.  Consistent 16-pixel padding is used around content sections for comfortable readability.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:**  The user flow is straightforward.  The user sees their current profile information, can edit fields directly, and then saves the changes with a confirmation button.  Error handling is built into the input fields, providing immediate feedback.

4. **Component Choices:** For input fields, I chose the `10:8492` ("text input") component over using native text fields because it provides built-in placeholder text, label alignment, and error handling within the design system.  The "Save Changes" button uses the `10:3907` ("Button") component, prioritizing the system's consistent button styles and accessibility features over custom implementations.  List items to present information are created using the `10:10214` component for consistency with other list implementations throughout the design system, even though there may be some customizations needed later.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "Profile Page" component.  To address this, I leveraged the layout containers to arrange existing components like  `10:8492` (text input),  `10:8619` (text area) for password update (due to its multi-line requirement), and `10:3907` (button) to create the required structure. This allows for a consistent look and feel while accommodating the functional requirements of the user request.  Dividers are used to separate distinct sections for better visual organization.


6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established using a combination of spacing, typography, and color.  Section headings use a larger, bolder text style than the input field labels. Input labels are visually separated from fields for improved clarity.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  For the input fields (`10:8492`), the "Filled" type (`Type`: "Filled") variant is chosen to offer a clear visual distinction between the label and input area. The default "enabled" state is used until the user interacts with the component. The button (`10:3907`) uses the "Filled", "Medium", "Default", and "Green" variants for visual prominence and clarity.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  No native elements are necessary, as all functional requirements are addressed using components from the design system.  The combination of available components, and strategic layout design delivers the intended functionality and consistency without compromising the design system.
