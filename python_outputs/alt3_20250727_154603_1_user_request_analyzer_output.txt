Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their accounts via the application.
Platform Impact: Mobile users are often in distracting environments and need quick, secure access with a touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates efficient design.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Utilize social media login options for convenient access; recover forgotten credentials.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if:  Primary action (login button) is clearly the most prominent element; all form fields are appropriately sized for mobile touch interaction; error messages have designated space; password recovery and terms & conditions are clearly linked and visible.


Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (specify platforms if known), password recovery link.
Contextual: Error messages (for incorrect credentials, etc.), success/failure feedback, loading indicators.  Footnote regarding acceptance of Terms & Conditions.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Likely a single-column layout due to mobile constraints, elements vertically stacked.
* Components:  Two input fields (username/email, password), one primary button (Login), multiple secondary buttons (Social Logins -  specify platforms if known),  link to password recovery,  text for T&C footnote.
* Styling:  (No styling specifics provided in the request, but should adhere to platform guidelines and app branding.)


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Social media login.
Screen States: Default state (showing login form), loading state (during authentication), error states (invalid credentials, network issues), success state (redirect to app home).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email/username format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication, success/failure messaging post-authentication attempt.
