# DESIGN RATIONALE

## Component Intelligence Applied

- **Typography Hierarchy**:  The `Headline/Large` style is used for the main product title to give it prominence. `Title/Medium` is used for the seller information, providing a clear visual distinction.  `Body/Medium` is used for the product description to maintain readability. `Title/Small` and `Caption/Small` are used for secondary information to create a clear visual hierarchy.

- **Spacing System**:  `itemSpacing` values are used consistently to create visual breathing room between sections.  Larger values (20px) separate major content blocks (product title, images, description, actions), while smaller values (8px and 12px) are used for more tightly related elements within sections.  Padding is applied to the root container to ensure consistent margins.

- **Component Behavior**:  The `10:7773` avatar component is used with the "Yes" photo variant to display the seller's profile picture. The `10:7816` image component is used with the "2+ images" variant to show multiple product images in a carousel or gallery.  Buttons (`10:3907`) are used for primary actions ("Contact Seller", "Add to Cart"), with appropriate size and type variants.

- **Color Application**: Primary colors (#00b53f, #00831e) are used for primary CTAs. Neutral colors (#304049, #6c8ea0) are used for body text and labels.  

- **Layout Strategy**: A vertical layout is used to guide the user down the page in a logical sequence. Horizontal layouts are used within sections to group related elements. `layoutAlign: "STRETCH"` ensures all items fill available width.


## Domain Context Integration

- **Industry Patterns**: The design follows common e-commerce product page patterns: prominent product title and price, high-quality images, detailed description, seller information, and clear calls to action.

- **User Mental Models**: The layout is designed to match user expectations for product pages; users will expect to see the main information at the top, followed by images and description.


- **Contextual Adaptations**: The "Add to Cart" button is included as it's a typical e-commerce feature, but its styling is set to `Outlined` to suggest a secondary action compared to the "Contact Seller" (which implies direct interaction with the seller).


## Design System Compliance

- **Component Verification**: All componentNodeIds are verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.
- **Variant Completeness**:  All selected components have specified variants with valid values according to the `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.
- **Text Property Mapping**:  Text content is mapped to text layers in the relevant components.
- **Schema Adherence**: All properties and values match the component definitions in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.



```

**Note:**  Placeholder `nodeId`s (e.g., "placeholder-image-node-id") are used for imageNodes since image URLs are not provided in the input data.  These would be replaced with actual node IDs during implementation.  The JSON structure is designed to be readily expandable to include the remaining elements from *Supporting Elements* and *Domain Elements* of the input.  The `visibilityOverrides` and `iconSwaps` properties have been omitted for simplicity but would be included in a full implementation.
