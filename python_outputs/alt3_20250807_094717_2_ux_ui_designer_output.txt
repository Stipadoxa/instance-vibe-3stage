I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs referenced below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The login screen uses a vertical layout (`layoutMode: "VERTICAL"`) to organize elements logically from top to bottom.  Each form field and the button are given sufficient spacing for clear visual separation.  The "Forgot Password?" link is placed below the login button, maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. The `horizontalSizing` property is set to `"FILL"` for full-width elements like the input fields and button, ensuring they span the entire width of the screen.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow is straightforward: users enter their email and password, then tap the "Login" button. The "Forgot Password?" link provides an alternative path for users who have forgotten their credentials.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose the `10:8492` ("text input") component for the email and password fields because it provides built-in placeholder text and styling consistent with the design system.  I considered using `10:8619` ("text area"), but its vertical scrolling functionality is unnecessary for email/password inputs.  For the login button, I used the `10:3907` ("Button") component with `variants: {"Type": "Filled", "Size": "Medium", "Color": "Green", "State": "Default"}` for a clear and prominent call to action. Alternatives such as a Text button were rejected because they lack the visual prominence required for a primary action.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a built-in password visibility toggle within the `10:8492` input component.  To address this, I used native elements: `native-rectangle` for the eye icon and a `native-text` link for "Forgot Password?". The toggle solution ensures password visibility while remaining functional and user-friendly.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** Visual hierarchy is established through a combination of: (a) Vertical positioning of elements, placing the most important elements (email, password, login button) at the top (b) The use of a filled button in primary color provides prominence to the main action (c) Typography: Consistent text styles are used as specified in DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA, ensuring clear visual distinction between labels, input placeholders, and button text.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  For the button, I chose `"Type": "Filled"` for better visual prominence, `"Size": "Medium"` to accommodate the text label and maintain appropriate scaling, and `"Color": "Green"` to align with the design system's established color palette for positive actions.  I chose `"State": "Default"` as this is the initial state of the button.  For the input fields, I chose `"Type": "Filled"` and `"State": "enabled"` which provide the necessary layout and functionality.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  To implement the password visibility toggle, which is not directly available as a component, I implemented the functionality using a `native-rectangle` element for the eye icon that toggles between the visible and hidden states in response to user interaction (not shown in JSON as implementation is outside the scope).  A `native-text` element will be used for the "Forgot password?" link to render the text.
