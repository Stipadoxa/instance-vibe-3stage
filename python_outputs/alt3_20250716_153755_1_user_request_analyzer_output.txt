Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management.  Specific context is a mobile application for Cars45 auction.
User Type: Registered users of the Cars45 mobile app managing their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, intuitive settings page with clear touch targets due to smaller screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  The design must account for interruptions and potential network limitations.


User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage notification preferences, and securely log out of the application.
Secondary Goals:  Easily access help/information regarding account settings (e.g., "What is it?"),  understand account status (e.g., "Active" status for auction access).
User Constraints: Limited screen space on a mobile device, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, and varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All settings options from the reference image are included, using the company's existing design system components, top and bottom navigation bars are implemented, and all interactive elements meet minimum touch target size requirements.


Content Requirements
Critical:  Personal details section, business details section, access to Cars45 auction toggle (with status indicator), "Verified ID" badge (with explanation), change phone number option, change email option, change language option, disable chats toggle, disable feedback toggle, manage notifications option, change password option, delete account option, log out option.
Supporting:  Clear visual indicators for toggles (on/off states),  "What is it?" explanations for unclear settings.
Contextual:  Loading indicators for actions that require server interaction (e.g., saving changes), success/error messages for setting modifications.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical list of settings options following the layout shown in the reference image. Top and bottom app navigation bars are required.
* Components:  Use existing company components for list items, toggles, and buttons.  The list items should follow the format shown in the reference image (text label, possible status indicators, right arrow for deeper settings).
* Styling:  Follow the existing company design system's styling guidelines regarding typography, colors, and spacing.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Access and modify individual setting options (tapping on a setting row).
Secondary Actions:  Log out of the app.
Screen States:  Default state (displaying all settings), loading states (while saving changes), success/error states (after attempting to save changes).
Feedback Needs:  Visual feedback for toggle changes (on/off), loading indicators, confirmation messages after saving changes, error messages for any failed actions.
