  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and easily scannable list due to limited screen real estate.  Touch interaction is primary; design needs to account for finger-sized tap targets.  Notifications must be easily digestible at a glance.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View and understand recent notifications.\nSecondary Goals: Quickly assess the importance and nature of each notification.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.\nReady for handoff if: Five notification items are displayed correctly, all content elements are visible and appropriately sized for touch interaction, top bar and bottom navigation are present and functional, and there are no layout overlaps.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the five notifications), user information in the top bar.\nSupporting:  None specified in the request.\nContextual:  Potentially, a counter to display the total number of unread notifications (if this is a feature).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical list of five notification items. Top bar at the top, bottom navigation at the bottom.\n* Components: Top Bar (containing user info), Notification Item (containing user avatar, title, description, timestamp), Bottom Navigation.\n* Styling:  Not specified in the request.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (tapping a notification item).\nSecondary Actions: None specified in the request.  Potentially navigating to other screens via bottom navigation.\nScreen States:  Default (showing five notifications), potentially a \"No Notifications\" state if applicable.\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of which notification items have been read vs. unread.  Haptic feedback upon tapping a notification item is preferable on mobile.\n",
