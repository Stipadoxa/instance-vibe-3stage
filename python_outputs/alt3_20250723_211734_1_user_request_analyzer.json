  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain for mobile application access\nUser Type: Mobile application users attempting to log in.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, touch-friendly interface with clear visual hierarchy and minimal input.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of critical information.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Securely authenticate and gain access to the mobile application.\nSecondary Goals: Utilize convenient social media login options; recover forgotten credentials.\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All interactive elements (fields, buttons) meet minimum tappable area size guidelines; error states are clearly defined and displayed; password recovery and terms & conditions are clearly linked;  social login buttons are visually distinct from the main login button; visual design aligns with the provided reference image.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.\nSupporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), password recovery link.\nContextual: Error messages for invalid credentials, loading indicator during authentication, success confirmation.  Footnote indicating acceptance of Terms and Conditions.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  Vertical layout with fields above buttons.  Primary login button positioned prominently below fields.  Social login buttons arranged horizontally below the primary button.  Password recovery and T&C footnote at the bottom.\n* Components:  Text fields for username/email and password.  Primary button for credential login.  Social media login buttons styled according to platform standards (e.g., Facebook, Google icons).  Hyperlink for password recovery.  Footnote text for T&C acceptance.\n* Styling:  Refer to provided visual reference image for guidance on color palette, button styles, and overall visual language.  Maintain consistency with the application's design system.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.\nSecondary Actions: Login via social media.\nScreen States: Default (initial), loading, error (incorrect credentials), success (redirect to app).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation of email format and password strength (if applicable); clear error messages; loading indicator; success confirmation (e.g., brief message or transition to application content).\n\n",
