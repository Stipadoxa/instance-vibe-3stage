Domain & Context
Domain: Settings management within a mobile application.
User Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account preferences and personal information.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates a concise and easily navigable settings screen with large touch targets due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  Users may be multitasking or in distracting environments.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify personal details (phone number, email, language).
Secondary Goals:  Navigate easily between settings options, understand the impact of changes.
User Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile device, potential for interruptions, reliance on touch input.
Ready for handoff if: All settings options are clearly listed, each option leads to a correctly functioning screen (or in-place modification), and all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction. Top app bar and bottom navigation are present and functional.

Content Requirements
Critical:  "Personal details" section header, "Change phone number" option, "Change email" option, "Change language" option.
Supporting:  Clear instructions or help text for each setting option.  
Contextual:  Success/failure messages after making changes, loading indicators during asynchronous operations (e.g., changing email).

Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** Vertical list for settings items.
*   **Components:** Top app bar (likely containing app title or back button), list items for each setting (each item could be a button or tappable element), bottom navigation bar (with appropriate icons/labels for navigation destinations).
*   **Styling:**  Adherence to the overall application's visual style guide.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Select a setting to change (e.g., tap "Change phone number").
Secondary Actions:  Navigate to other screens via bottom navigation.
Screen States: Default state (showing the list of settings), loading state (while making changes), success/error state (after attempting to make changes).
Feedback Needs:  Clear visual indication of which setting is selected, confirmation of successful changes, error messages for invalid input or failed changes (e.g., email already in use).
