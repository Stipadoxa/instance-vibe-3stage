Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management and settings configuration.  Specific context is a mobile application likely related to auctions or similar business transactions (Cars45 reference suggests this).
User Type: Mobile app users who need to manage their account settings, preferences, and personal information.  This includes users managing their business profiles if applicable.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive settings page due to screen size limitations. Touch interactions must be considered, and design should account for potential interruptions.


User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify personal information, manage account preferences (e.g., notifications, language), review account status (e.g., verified ID), and manage business details (if applicable).
Secondary Goals:  Easily understand the purpose and implications of each setting, securely manage sensitive information (e.g., password), receive clear feedback on changes made.
User Constraints: Small screen real estate necessitates prioritization and concise information design. Touch interactions must be precise and easy to use. Users may be interrupted during interaction.
Ready for handoff if:  All settings listed in the reference image are present and functional, using components from the provided design system.  Navigation is intuitive and clear.  Touch targets meet minimum size requirements.


Content Requirements
Critical:  Personal details (edit option), Business details (edit option), Access to Cars45 auction (status indicator), "Verified ID" badge (status and explanation link), Change phone number, Change email, Change language, Disable chats, Disable feedback, Manage notifications, Change password, Delete my account permanently, Log out.
Supporting:  Clear visual indicators of active/inactive states, help text ("What is it?") for unclear settings.
Contextual: Error messages for invalid input, loading indicators for actions requiring server communication, confirmation messages after changes.


Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Single-column list view, similar to the reference image, utilizing the provided design system components (list items, buttons, etc.).
* Components:  Use pre-existing list item components from the provided design system.  Buttons for actions (e.g., "Change phone number").  Switch components for toggles (e.g., "Disable chats").  A status indicator component for settings with states (e.g., "Access to Cars45 auction").
* Styling: Adhere to the color scheme and visual hierarchy demonstrated in the reference image, aligning with the design system's established patterns.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Navigating to a specific setting, modifying a setting value (e.g., changing email address), activating/deactivating a setting (e.g., disabling chats), confirming account deletion.
Secondary Actions: Accessing help or explanatory information ("What is it?").
Screen States:  Default state, loading states (if applicable), error states, success/confirmation states.
