  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication domain with secure access control\nUser Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate necessitates efficient layout.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account.\nSecondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials (link to password reset flow), use convenient login options (consider this for future iterations).\nUser Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: Login button is most prominent, all form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, placeholder text is clear and concise, error messages have designated space, and sufficient padding/spacing around elements prevents accidental touches.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Heading (e.g., \"Login\"), Email field (with appropriate keyboard type), Password field (with secure input masking), Submit button (clearly labeled \"Login\").\nSupporting: Password recovery link (linking to a separate password reset screen),  \"Remember me\" checkbox (optional, but recommended for user convenience).\nContextual: Error messages (displayed below respective fields or as a summary), loading indicator (during authentication).\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Single column layout to maximize vertical space usage.\n* Components: Heading (H1 or H2), Email input field, Password input field, Submit button.\n* Styling:  Consider platform-consistent styling guidelines for mobile login screens.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Submit login credentials.\nSecondary Actions: Initiate password recovery (via link).\nScreen States: Default state (form fields visible), loading state (spinner/progress indicator shown), error state (error messages displayed).\nFeedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format, clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.\n",
