  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Authentication and User Profile Management within a mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings, view profile information, and control notification preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise settings page with clear visual hierarchy and easily accessible controls due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  They may be in distracting environments and prefer quick access to core functionalities.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View and update user profile information, manage notification preferences, log out of the application securely.\nSecondary Goals: Access help or support resources related to account settings.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space on mobile devices, touch-only interaction, potential interruptions, varying network conditions.\nReady for handoff if: All primary actions (profile view, notification toggle, logout) are clearly visible and easily accessible via touch targets;  a clear visual hierarchy guides the user through the settings;  error states are anticipated and accounted for.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User profile information (name, email, etc.), notification toggle switch (on/off), logout button.\nSupporting:  Help/support link, version number of the application.\nContextual:  Error messages (e.g., for network issues during profile updates), success messages (e.g., after logging out), loading indicators (e.g., when saving profile changes).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n\n*   **Layout:** Single-column layout optimized for vertical scrolling on mobile. Sections clearly separated with appropriate headings.\n*   **Components:** Profile section (with editable fields or view-only fields depending on design choices), Toggle switch for notifications, Logout button styled as a destructive action (e.g., red background), Help icon or link.\n*   **Styling:**  Consistent with overall app branding, clear visual hierarchy using headings, spacing, and potentially subtle visual separators between sections.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View/edit profile, toggle notifications, log out.\nSecondary Actions: Access help/support.\nScreen States: Default state (showing profile and settings), loading state (while saving changes), error state (if changes fail to save).\nFeedback Needs: Visual feedback (e.g., checkmark) after successful changes, clear error messages with guidance on how to resolve issues.\n",
