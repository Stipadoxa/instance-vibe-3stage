Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control for a mobile application
User Type: Mobile application users needing to access their accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users are often in distracting environments and need a quick, secure, and touch-friendly interface.  Screen real estate is limited.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the mobile application.
Secondary Goals: Log in using social media accounts; recover forgotten passwords.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All interactive elements have appropriately sized touch targets;  error messages are clearly displayed;  the primary action (login button) is visually prominent and distinct from secondary actions; password recovery link is easily accessible.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, primary login button.
Supporting: Social media login buttons (e.g., Facebook, Google), password recovery link.
Contextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials, etc.), loading indicator during authentication.  Footnote regarding Terms & Conditions acceptance upon login.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Likely a single-column layout due to mobile constraints, with fields stacked vertically.
* Components:  Two input fields (username/email and password), one primary button ("Log In"), multiple secondary buttons for social media logins, a hyperlink for password recovery, a footnote for T&C acceptance.
* Styling:  Specific styling (e.g., colors, fonts, button styles) not specified and should be determined based on the app's existing design language.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials, initiate password recovery.
Secondary Actions: Social media logins.
Screen States: Default state, loading state (during authentication), error states (invalid credentials, network issues), success state (redirect to app).
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation of email format and password strength (if applicable), clear and concise error messages, visual loading indicator.
