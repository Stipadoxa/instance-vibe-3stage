{
  "designRationale": {
    "layoutDecisions": "The layout uses a vertical stack for the main content, placing the full-width images at the top, followed by product details and the 'Contact Seller' button.  Spacing between sections is consistent with the design system's default spacing guidelines.",
    "userFlowReasoning": "The user flow is designed to be straightforward. The user first sees the product images, then the key details (title, price, seller info), and finally a prominent call to action to contact the seller. This promotes quick understanding and efficient interaction.",
    "componentChoices": "I chose the 'appbar' (10:5620) component for the top navigation because it provides a standardized and familiar interface for mobile apps.  I considered using a custom header but decided against it to maintain design system consistency. The 'button' (10:3907) component was selected for the 'Contact Seller' button due to its clear visual affordance and wide range of customization options. Alternatives like using a native rectangle or a text-based button were considered, but rejected due to lower visual clarity and lack of standard interaction patterns.",
    "componentGaps": "The user request requires a full-width image carousel, but the design system lacks a dedicated carousel component. I implemented a workaround using a horizontal auto-layout container with multiple 'image' components (10:7816). This provides the desired full-width image display with smooth scrolling, replicating the essential functionality of a carousel while maintaining adherence to the design system.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Visual hierarchy is established through a combination of typography, spacing, and color.  The product title uses the 'Headline/Large' text style for prominence, while other details use smaller text styles based on importance. The 'Contact Seller' button stands out with its bright 'Primary/primary50' color and bold text.",
    "variantSelectionRationale": "For the 'button' component (10:3907), I chose the 'Size: Large', 'Type: Filled', 'Color: Green', and 'State: Default' variants to create a prominent and visually appealing call to action. The large size ensures good tap target, the filled type highlights its importance, and the green color provides positive visual cues. Other color options were considered, but green best matched the brand's visual language and positive connotations of contact and communication.",
    "nativeElementJustification": "The user request for displaying seller location necessitates functionality not directly provided by the design system. No specific component offers an integrated method for showing an address along with an avatar.  Therefore, a `native-text` element is used to display the location information in conjunction with the 'avatar' (24:10352) component. This provides precise control over location layout and text hierarchy while ensuring that the avatar icon remains within the design system framework."
