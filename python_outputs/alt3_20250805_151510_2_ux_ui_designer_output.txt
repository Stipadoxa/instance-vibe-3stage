I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The dashboard homepage uses a vertical layout to organize information hierarchically. The top section features a horizontal layout for quick stats cards, allowing for a clear visual comparison.  These cards have a fixed width to ensure consistent spacing and visual balance across different screen sizes. The recent activity feed below uses a vertical layout, accommodating various content lengths.  The bottom navigation bar is positioned at the very bottom, for easy accessibility. Consistent 16px padding is used throughout for a comfortable viewing experience.  Full-width elements (such as potential hero images, if added later) will use `horizontalSizing: "FILL"`.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The primary user flow is to quickly scan key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total listings, views, and messages. From there, users can explore details in the recent activity feed or take direct action by creating a new listing or reviewing all messages.  The bottom navigation provides quick access to other essential sections of the seller dashboard.

4. **Component Choices:**  I chose the `Bottom navigation` component (`10:4724`) for the bottom navigation bar due to its established design and accessibility features.  This component provides a standard UI pattern users are familiar with. I did not use the `List item` component (`10:10214`) for the activity feed because this component is marked as `list-item` and using this type directly is forbidden according to the constraints. Instead, a `layoutContainer` will be used to achieve the same visual presentation and to comply with rendering requirements.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated component for displaying quick stats cards.  To address this gap, I used a combination of `native-rectangle` components with image fills for icons, and `native-text` elements to display values. This approach maintains a consistent visual style while fulfilling the functional requirement without resorting to forbidden native element types.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established by using clear visual separation between sections (padding and dividers).  The quick stats cards are emphasized through their positioning at the top and by using primary colors.  The recent activity feed has secondary importance with a lighter color palette. The action buttons have prominent colors and sufficient spacing to differentiate them.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the bottom navigation (`10:4724`), the `Mobile` variant from `Device` is used to optimize display for mobile users and improve device-specific rendering.  There isn't sufficient information regarding specific content for buttons, so default variants will be used for button components.  The color and other properties will be manually specified to meet the style guide.  

8. **Native Element Justification:** The quick stats cards require a custom layout structure that's not possible with existing components. Using `native-rectangle` and `native-text` provides the necessary visual appearance and flexibility. The use of native elements is explicitly justified by functional needs, not merely aesthetic preferences.
