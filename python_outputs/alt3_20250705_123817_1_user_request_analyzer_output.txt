Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain with product discovery
User Type: Mobile users browsing product categories
Platform Impact: Mobile users need quick and intuitive navigation with minimal taps, prioritizing visual discovery of products. Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient use of space.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Browse product categories, initiate a product search.
Secondary Goals:  Efficiently switch between categories, easily find desired products.
User Constraints: Limited screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Search bar is functional and clearly visible within the app bar, tabs are easily tappable, and scrolling is smooth and responsive.  All tab labels are visible without truncation.

Content Requirements
Critical:  "Electronics," "Home Goods," "Vehicles" tabs, Search bar. Product listings (placeholder content acceptable for initial handoff).
Supporting:  Loading indicator for product data, potential for a "View All" option (depending on product quantity per category).
Contextual:  Error messages (e.g., network error), search results displayed based on user input.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: App bar with search bar, scrollable horizontal tabs below the app bar. Main content area below tabs to display product listings.
* Components: App bar (containing search bar), horizontal scrollable tabs, product list container.
* Styling:  Styling will need to be defined separately.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions:  Initiate a search, select a product category.
Secondary Actions:  None explicitly specified in the request.  This could include things like filtering and sorting, which might be added in later iterations.
Screen States: Default state (tabs visible, product list area may be loading), search results state (displaying results matching user input), loading state, error state.
Feedback Needs: Loading indicator while fetching product data for selected categories, clear indication of selected tab.
