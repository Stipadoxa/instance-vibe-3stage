Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Product Search Results Page

**Domain Analysis**

Primary Domain: E-commerce  Confidence Level: High (90%+)
Key Evidence: "product cards," "search results page," "filters" are all strongly associated with e-commerce product browsing and filtering functionalities.  The request explicitly mentions "product" multiple times.
Alternative Domains Considered: None. The terms used are directly indicative of an e-commerce context.  The request lacks any characteristics of other domains like finance ("transactions," "payments"), healthcare ("patient records"), or education ("courses," "assignments").
Validation Check: The evidence strongly supports an e-commerce domain. The absence of keywords or context associated with other domains further solidifies this classification.

**Core Use Cases**

1. **Targeted Product Search:** A user searches for "blue running shoes" and uses the filters (size, brand) to narrow down the results, viewing product cards to compare options.

2. **Filtering by Category and Price:** A user searches for "headphones" and uses the filters (price range, type) to quickly identify headphones within a specific budget and category.

3. **Browsing Related Products:** After viewing a specific product card, a user explores other related products shown in the results.

4. **Refining Search Results:** A user initially searches for "dress shirts," gets too many results, and uses filters (color, size, brand) to refine the search and improve the relevance of results.

5. **Handling No Results:** The user searches for a highly specific item and receives a "No Results Found" message with suggestions for alternative searches or related items.

6. **Mobile Search:** A user uses their phone to search for a product during their lunch break, quickly evaluating a few product cards before committing to visit a product page.


**Functional Requirements**

1. **Search Functionality (Priority: Critical)**
    * Purpose: Enables users to find desired products quickly.

    * Data Requirements:  Product catalog data (name, description, price, images, etc.), search index.
    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the product catalog database and potentially a search engine API (e.g., Elasticsearch).


2. **Filtering Functionality (Priority: High)**
    * Purpose: Allows users to refine search results based on specific criteria.
    * Core Capabilities:  Three horizontal filters (pre-defined, customizable),  dynamic update of results based on filter selections, clear filter selections.
    * Data Requirements:  Product attribute data (e.g., size, color, brand, price range).
    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the product catalog database.


3. **Product Card Display (Priority: High)**
    * Purpose: Presents concise information about products to aid in comparison.
    * Core Capabilities:  Display of product image, name, price, short description.  "Add to Cart" functionality for each product.
    * Data Requirements:  Product data (image URLs, names, prices, descriptions).
    * Integration Needs:  Integration with the shopping cart system and product detail pages.


4. **Pagination/Sorting (Priority: Medium)**
    * Purpose: Enables efficient browsing of large result sets.
    * Core Capabilities:  Pagination of search results, sorting options (e.g., price, relevance).
    * Data Requirements:  Number of results, current page, sorting criteria.
    * Integration Needs: None.


5. **Error Handling (Priority: High)**
    * Purpose: Gracefully handles unexpected situations.

* Improved average order value (AOV)
* Reduced bounce rate from search results page
* Increased search query volume
* Improved customer satisfaction scores (CSAT)

Performance Targets:
* Search results should load within 1 second.
* Filter updates should be near-instantaneous.
* Page load time should be under 3 seconds.
* 99.9% uptime.

Compliance:  PCI DSS compliance (if handling payment information directly on the page), GDPR compliance (if collecting user data).


**User Experience Requirements**

Information Priority:  Product name, image, price should be most prominent.  Filter options and sorting should be clearly visible.
Interaction Patterns:  Intuitive filtering mechanisms (dropdown menus, checkboxes), clear visual feedback on filter selections, smooth pagination.
Platform Constraints:  Responsive design for various screen sizes, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).


This PRD provides a comprehensive outline for the development of the enhanced search results page, minimizing ambiguity and allowing for efficient collaboration between product, design, and engineering teams.
