Platform Impact: Mobile users need concise information, large touch targets, and a streamlined purchasing process.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of key information.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Quickly view product details, initiate purchase
Secondary Goals:  See product image clearly, understand pricing, easily add to cart
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, need for clear visual hierarchy.

Content Requirements
Critical: Product image, product title, product price, "Buy" button
Supporting:  Rating/review summary (if available), short description (if space allows)
Contextual:  "Added to Cart" message, out-of-stock indicator, sale price overlay

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single vertical column layout for optimal mobile display.  Image at the top, followed by title, price, and button.
* Components:  High-quality product image, clear and concise title, prominently displayed price (with currency symbol), large "Buy" button with clear visual feedback on tap.
* Styling: Use consistent brand styling, high-contrast text for readability. "Buy" button should have clear visual indication (e.g., color) to stand out.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Add to cart/buy product
Secondary Actions: (Potentially) View product details page
Screen States: Default (showing product information), "Added to Cart" state (brief visual confirmation)
Feedback Needs:  Visual confirmation of button press, clear error messages (if applicable, e.g., out of stock).

Ready for handoff if:  All critical content is displayed clearly and concisely within a single, vertically oriented layout,  touch targets meet minimum size guidelines, and the "Buy" button provides clear visual feedback on tap.
