I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout utilizes a vertical structure for the overall screen. The search bar and filter button occupy the top section, providing immediate access.  Below, a horizontal, wrapping layout container arranges product cards in a responsive grid.  Consistent spacing of 16px is used between items and sections for visual clarity and mobile responsiveness.  Full-width elements utilize `"horizontalSizing": "FILL"` to adapt to different screen sizes.

3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user flow starts with the search bar at the top for quick product searches. The filter button allows users to refine their searches. Product cards are displayed in a visually appealing grid layout enabling easy browsing and selection. The product cards themselves present key information (image, title, price, rating) concisely.

4. **Component Choices:** 
    - For the search bar, I chose `10:12086` ("search-field") over creating a custom input field because it's a pre-built, well-styled component within the design system that already provides essential features like placeholder text and a built-in clear button.  It is visually consistent with other elements from the design system.
    - I chose `10:3907` ("Button") for the filter button because it seamlessly integrates with the design system's visual language. Using a native button component would have risked inconsistency.
    - For product cards, I chose `147:3743` ("product card") as it's specifically designed for this purpose, providing a structured layout for product details.  Building a custom card would introduce inconsistencies and extra development effort.

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a rating component (`native-rating` is forbidden). I've addressed this by creating a workaround using multiple instances of the `635:4752` ("icon/star") component with the `Star` variant set to "full", "half", or "empty" to represent the rating. This maintains visual consistency with the rest of the design system.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The search bar and filter button are prominently displayed at the top, establishing visual priority.  Product cards are given sufficient visual weight through the use of consistent spacing and appropriate text sizes, emphasizing product titles and prices.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the "search-field" component, I chose the `"State": "default"` variant as it is the most appropriate for the initial state. I selected `"view": "grid"` for the `product-card` component since it fits the use case of displaying a collection of products as a grid.

8. **Native Element Justification:**  I used `native-rectangle` components for product image placeholders because there is no image component available in the Design System. This fulfills the functional requirement of showcasing product images while adhering to the constraints.
