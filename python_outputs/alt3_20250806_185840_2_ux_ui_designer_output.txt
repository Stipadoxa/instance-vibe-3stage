SECTIONS:

gallery: This section displays multiple product photos using the `IMAGES` component (id: `10:7816`), allowing users to quickly assess the laptop's visual condition.  It serves the `gallery` section purpose in the E-commerce pattern.

essentials: This section presents core details like the title ("HP Spectre x360 14-inch (2020) - Used"), price ("$850.00"), and condition ("Good").  It uses `native-text` for the title and condition and  a `native-text` for the price,  fulfilling the `essentials` section purpose in the E-commerce pattern.  Specifications and included items will be in a list using the `List item` component (id: `10:10214`).

purchase: This section contains the primary CTA, "Contact Seller," implemented with the `Button` component (id: `10:3907`), enabling direct interaction with the seller. This addresses the `purchase` section purpose within the E-commerce pattern.  A secondary button, "View Seller Profile," using the same `Button` component, provides additional seller information.


DESIGN RATIONALE:

Component Inventory Verification: I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

Section Planning: The page follows the E-commerce pattern (gallery→essentials→purchase→seller→metadata).  The `reviews` and `related` sections are omitted as they were not explicitly requested. The `seller` section is incorporated into the `essentials` section for a more concise layout. Metadata information is placed in a separate section below.

Layout Decisions: The layout is vertical, conforming to the Hierarchical Container Sizing rules.  The `gallery` section is at the top for visual impact, followed by `essentials` and `purchase`. Level 1 containers have 16px padding. Nested containers (Level 2+) auto-size to their content.

User Flow Reasoning: The user flow is straightforward: view the gallery, check the essentials, and contact the seller.  The secondary button allows users to explore the seller's profile for added confidence.

Component Choices: I chose the `IMAGES` component for the image gallery because it efficiently handles multiple images. I chose the `Button` component for CTAs due to its clear action affordances and design system compliance. The `List item` component was selected for its clear presentation of key-value pairs.

Component Gaps: The request requires a flexible layout for the product details,  adapting to varying lengths of specifications and included items. The design system lacks a component for this specific use case. I am using the `List item` component repeatedly, which provides an acceptable, albeit not optimal solution.


Visual Hierarchy: Visual hierarchy is established through size and position. The gallery images are largest, the title is prominently sized, and the CTA button is clearly separated.

Variant Selection Rationale: For the `Button` component, I chose the "Medium" size and "Default" state for a standard appearance.  The "Green" color was selected for the primary CTA to signal a positive action.

Native Element Justification:  `native-text` elements were used for the title, price, and condition details because no single component in the design system could precisely fulfill the requirement for styling these specific texts within their respective sections and accommodate dynamic text length.
