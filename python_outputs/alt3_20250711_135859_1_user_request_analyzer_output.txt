Domain & Context
Domain: Authentication domain with secure access control
User Type: Mobile users needing to access their personal accounts
Platform Impact: Mobile users often in distracting environments, need quick secure access with touch-friendly interface, limited screen real estate.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely, access personal account
Secondary Goals: Create a new account, recover forgotten credentials
User Constraints: Small screen, touch-only interaction, may be interrupted, varying network conditions
Ready for handoff if: "Sign in" button is prominent, all form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, "Sign up" button is clearly secondary, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.

Content Requirements
Critical:  "Welcome" title, email field, password field, "Sign in" button
Supporting: "Sign up" button
Contextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials), loading indicator (during authentication), password recovery link (potentially).

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout: Single column layout optimized for mobile.
* Components: Title (Welcome), Email input field, Password input field, Primary button ("Sign in"), Secondary button ("Sign up")
* Styling:  To be determined by UX/UI designer based on branding guidelines.  Note the lack of styling directives in the user request.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Sign in
Secondary Actions: Sign up
Screen States: Default state, loading state, error state (invalid credentials), success state (redirection to account)
Feedback Needs: Real-time validation for email format (if applicable), clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.
