Domain & Context
Domain:  Generic dialog system within a mobile application.  The specific context is unclear and requires further information.
User Type: Mobile application users who need to interact with system-level dialogs presenting information and requiring a decision.
Platform Impact: Mobile users interact via touch, have limited screen real estate, and may be easily distracted.  The dialog should be concise and easy to understand.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Understand the information presented in the title and subtitle, and make a decision by interacting with the red button.
Secondary Goals:  The dialog should be easy to dismiss (if applicable, method of dismissal needs clarification).
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions.
Ready for handoff if: Title and subtitle text are clearly legible, the red button is appropriately sized for touch interaction, and the dialog's visual hierarchy is clear.

Content Requirements
Critical: Title (short and descriptive), Subtitle (supplementary information), Red button (with clear label indicating action).
Supporting:  None specified, but potentially an icon to represent the dialog's purpose.
Contextual: None specified.  Further information is needed to determine if the content changes based on different scenarios.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Single-column layout, vertically stacking title, subtitle, and button.
* Components:  Title (Text component), Subtitle (Text component), Red Button (Button component).
* Styling: Button background color: Red.


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Tap the red button.
Secondary Actions:  Dismiss the dialog (method needs clarification - e.g., tap outside the dialog, back button).
Screen States:  Only one state is specified - the default state with title, subtitle and button.
Feedback Needs:  Visual feedback (e.g., button press state) on interaction with the button.  Haptic feedback may also be desirable.
