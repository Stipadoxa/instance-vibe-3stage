Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management
User Type: Mobile app users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and intuitive settings page with large, easily tappable elements due to limitations in screen real estate and touch interaction.  They may be using the app in various contexts and may be interrupted easily.

Primary Goals: Access and modify account settings, manage app preferences.
Secondary Goals:  Easily understand each setting's purpose and effect. Access help or information where needed.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: All settings from the reference image are included, using existing app components, navigation is clear and consistent with app standards, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.
