Domain & Context
Domain: Business/SaaS domain with user authentication
User Type: SaaS application users accessing the application on mobile devices.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a quick and secure login process with a touch-friendly interface, considering limited screen real estate and potential for interruptions.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Authenticate quickly and securely to access the SaaS application.
Secondary Goals: Recover forgotten credentials.
User Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, varying network conditions.
Ready for handoff if: Login button is prominent, password recovery link is clearly visible, form fields are appropriately sized for mobile, error messages have designated space, and "Forgot Password?" text is center-aligned.

Content Requirements
Critical: Username/email field, password field, login button, "Forgot Password?" link.
Supporting:  None specified in original request or modification.
Contextual: Error messages (for invalid credentials), loading indicators (during authentication).

Structural & Component Directives
* **Layout:** Vertical layout for login form elements.  "Username Input Container" and "Password Input Container" are vertically oriented with labels above input fields.  The "Forgot Password?" text is positioned below the login button.
* **Components:** Username/email text input (Filled, enabled), Password text input (Filled, enabled), Login button (Android+Web, Large, Filled, Default, Green), "Forgot Password?" text.
* **Styling:**  Login button is green.  No other styling explicitly defined beyond component types.

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Login with credentials.
Secondary Actions: Access password recovery.
Screen States: Default state, loading state (implied), error state (implied).
Feedback Needs: Clear error messages for login failures, loading indicators during authentication.


**Analysis of Modification Request:**

The modification request is a `Detailed Specification` focusing solely on the alignment of the "Forgot Password?" text.  The existing design and functionality should be preserved.  The only change required is to center-align the "Forgot Password?" text within its existing container or the screen itself, depending on the current implementation.  This is a simple visual adjustment that does not impact functionality or user flow.
