Domain & Context
Domain: E-commerce domain with product discovery and filtering within a marketplace app
User Type: Mobile users browsing and filtering products within a marketplace app.
Platform Impact: Mobile users need a concise and efficient search results page with easily accessible filters due to screen size limitations and touch interaction.  They may be browsing in various contexts and conditions (e.g., on the go, with limited attention span).

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Find relevant products quickly, efficiently filter results based on specific criteria.
Secondary Goals: View product details, sort results by relevance, price, or other parameters, refine search based on filter results.
User Constraints: Limited screen real estate, reliance on touch interaction, potential interruptions during browsing, varying network conditions impacting loading times.
Ready for handoff if:  Filter chips are clearly visible and interactive, search results are displayed efficiently,  pagination is implemented for large result sets, loading states are appropriately handled, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.

Content Requirements
Critical: Product listings (images, titles, prices), filter chips (e.g., category, price range, brand), pagination/scrolling mechanism, search bar (to refine search).
Supporting: Product ratings and reviews (summary or count), sorting options, total number of results displayed, filters applied indicator.
Contextual: "No results found" message, loading indicator while fetching results, improved search suggestions.

Structural & Component Directives
* Layout:  Vertical scrolling list of products, filter chips located above or below the product list (design decision pending further usability testing).
* Components: Product cards (image, title, price, rating summary), filter chips (with clear labels and current selection indicators), pagination buttons or infinite scroll.
* Styling: Consistent with the overall marketplace app's styling guide, clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention.  Filter chips should visually indicate selection state (e.g., active/inactive).


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Tap on a product to view details, select/deselect filter chips.
Secondary Actions: Sort results by different criteria, refine search query.
Screen States: Default state (showing initial search results), loading state (while fetching results), "no results" state, filtered state (displaying results after filter application).
Feedback Needs: Visual indication of active filters, smooth scrolling, clear loading indicators, immediate visual feedback upon filter selection, appropriate error handling (e.g., network errors).
