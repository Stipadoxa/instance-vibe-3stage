  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain:  Account settings management within a mobile application, likely related to a business or SaaS context (given the \"Business details\" setting).\nUser Type: Mobile app users who need to manage their account preferences and settings.  This includes users needing to update personal information, manage communication preferences, and control account security.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates a concise and intuitive interface with clear touch targets due to limited screen real estate and touch-based interaction.  The design must account for interruptions and potential distractions common in mobile usage contexts.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal account settings, manage notification preferences, update account information (personal and business), control privacy-related settings (chats, feedback), and securely log out.\nSecondary Goals: Easily understand the purpose of each setting, gain information on account status (e.g., \"Verified ID\" badge),  efficiently navigate through the settings.\nUser Constraints: Limited screen real estate, potential for interruptions, reliance on touch input, need for clarity and intuitive navigation.\nReady for handoff if: All settings listed in the reference image are present and functional, using the provided design system components.  Navigation is clear and intuitive, and touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.  The bottom navigation bar is implemented correctly.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical:  All settings from the reference image (\"Personal details,\" \"Business details,\" \"Access to Cars45 auction,\" \"Verified ID\" badge, \"Change phone number,\" \"Change email,\" \"Change language,\" \"Disable chats,\" \"Disable Feedback,\" \"Manage notifications,\" \"Change password,\" \"Delete my account permanently,\" \"Log out\").  Each setting should have a clear label.  The \"What is it?\" functionality needs to be implemented for the \"Verified ID\" badge.  Status indicators (like \"Active\") for relevant settings.\nSupporting:  Short descriptions or tooltips for settings where appropriate to aid understanding.\nContextual:  Confirmation dialogs before irreversible actions (e.g., deleting the account).  Loading indicators where applicable.\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout:  A single screen list view similar to the reference image.  The list items should be consistent with the design system's standards for list items.\n* Components:  Use the list item component from the design system.  The design system's toggle component for \"Disable chats,\" \"Disable Feedback,\"  and potentially \"Access to Cars45 auction\". The design system's button component for \"Log Out\" and \"Delete my account permanently\".  Use design system's standard icons, typography and color palette.\n* Styling: Adhere to the design system's existing styling guidelines for colors, typography, spacing, and iconography.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions:  Modify settings, log out, delete account.\nSecondary Actions: Access additional information for settings (e.g. \"What is it?\").\nScreen States:  Default state (showing all settings).  Loading state (while updating settings).  Success/error states after actions are performed.\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual feedback confirming setting changes. Error messaging for invalid inputs or failures during setting changes. Loading indicators during asynchronous operations.\n",
