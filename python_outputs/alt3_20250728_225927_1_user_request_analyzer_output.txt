Domain & Context
Domain: Communication/Information Delivery domain within a mobile application context.
User Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications.
Platform Impact: Limited screen real estate necessitates efficient information display; touch interaction is primary; interruptions are common; location awareness is not directly relevant.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: View a list of recent notifications; understand the content of each notification.
Secondary Goals: Potentially mark notifications as read; potentially interact with notifications directly (e.g., open related content).
User Constraints: Small screen size restricts content display; reliance on touch interaction; potential interruptions during notification review.
Ready for handoff if:  All five notification items are clearly visible and legible, user avatar, title, description, and timestamp are present for each notification, top bar and bottom navigation are implemented without overlap or obscuring content.

Content Requirements
Critical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, and timestamp for each of the five notifications.
Supporting:  Indicator of unread notifications (if applicable).
Contextual:  Potential for additional content based on notification type (e.g., a button to mark as read).

Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** Vertical list of 5 notification items; top bar at the top; bottom navigation at the bottom.
*   **Components:** Top bar containing user info (e.g., profile picture, name); Notification item: displays user avatar, title, description, and timestamp; Bottom navigation bar (with undefined number of tabs).
*   **Styling:**  (Unspecified, requires further design decisions).

Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: View notification details.
Secondary Actions: Mark as read (potential); interact with notification content (potential).
Screen States:  Default state (showing notification list); Potentially a "No Notifications" state.
Feedback Needs: Clear visual indication of read/unread status (if applicable).
