SECTIONS:

navigation: Contains the bottom navigation bar using the "Bottom navigation" component (10:4724) allowing users to easily switch between different sections of the seller dashboard. This adheres to the Dashboard pattern.

metrics: Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) using a custom layout of native-rectangle components to create stats cards showing "Total Listings," "Views This Week," and "New Messages." This is crucial for providing at-a-glance performance data to the seller and aligns with the Dashboard pattern.

actions:  Includes two primary action buttons: "Create New Listing" and "View All Messages," both implemented with the "Button" component (10:3907), guiding the user towards key tasks and aligning with the Dashboard pattern.  The primary action ("Create New Listing") is given more visual prominence through styling.

activity: Shows a recent activity feed leveraging the "List item" component (10:10214) to display recent events such as new messages and listing views. This keeps sellers informed and engaged. It aligns with the Profile and Dashboard patterns.

DESIGN RATIONALE:

Component Inventory Verification: I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

Section Planning: The design utilizes the Dashboard section pattern, including navigation, metrics, actions, and activity feeds, providing a comprehensive overview of the seller's performance and facilitating easy access to key actions.

Layout Decisions: The layout follows a top-to-bottom vertical structure. The root container has a width of 414px and `counterAxisSizingMode: "FIXED"`. Level 1 containers (navigation, metrics, actions, activity) use `"horizontalSizing": "FILL"` and 16px padding for consistent spacing. Nested containers within Level 1 sections size automatically to their content.

User Flow Reasoning: The user flow is straightforward. Sellers see their key metrics at a glance, then have clear access to actions (creating listings or viewing messages), followed by a feed of recent activity, ensuring quick access to information and task completion.

Component Choices: I chose "Bottom navigation" (10:4724) for the bottom navigation because it provides a standard and user-friendly way to navigate between sections.  I chose the "Button" component (10:3907) for action buttons for its clear visual cue and ease of interaction.  I chose the "List item" component (10:10214) for the activity feed because it offers an established and easily understandable display pattern for a list of items.

Component Gaps: The request requires customizable metric cards, which are not directly available as components in the design system. I constructed these using native-rectangle components with appropriate styling to provide the necessary functionality and visual appeal.

Visual Hierarchy: Visual hierarchy is established through size, color, and position. The metrics section has larger text and more prominent colors to draw the user's eye first. The action buttons have a clear visual distinction, with the primary action button having a more prominent color and size. The activity feed is placed below and uses a standard list layout to visually indicate its less critical, secondary nature.

Variant Selection Rationale: For the "Button" component (10:3907), I've used the "Filled" type for both buttons, and the "Large" size for the "Create New Listing" button to highlight it.  For the bottom navigation, all icons will be visible, and the current navigation item highlighted with a change in the "textColor". For the list item component, I chose to showcase both "Headline" and "Supporting text" properties.

Native Element Justification: Native-rectangle components were used to create the quick stats cards because no single component in the design system provided the exact combination of functionality (metrics display within a visually distinct card).
