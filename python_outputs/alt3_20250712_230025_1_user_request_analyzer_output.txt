Domain & Context
Domain: User settings management within a mobile application.
User Type: Mobile application users who need to manage their account settings and preferences.
Platform Impact: Mobile platform necessitates a concise layout, clear touch targets, and consideration for interruptions and limited screen real estate.  Navigation must be intuitive due to the smaller screen size.

User Requirements
Primary Goals: Access and modify personal details, change contact information, change language preferences, delete account.
Secondary Goals:  Log out of the application securely.
User Constraints: Limited screen space, reliance on touch input, potential for interruptions during use.
Ready for handoff if: All primary actions are clearly accessible and labeled, top app bar and bottom navigation are implemented correctly, and touch targets meet accessibility guidelines.

Content Requirements
Critical: Personal details section (displaying current information), "Change phone number" action, "Change email" action, "Change language" selection, "Delete my account permanently" action, "Log out" action.
Supporting:  Clear indication of successful changes, confirmation dialogs before irreversible actions (account deletion).
Contextual:  Error messages for invalid inputs, loading indicators during data updates.

Structural & Component Directives
*   **Layout:** Vertical list of settings items.  Top app bar and bottom navigation bar.
*   **Components:** Top app bar (containing app title or logo, potentially a back button), list items (each with a label and action - either direct edit or navigation to a secondary screen), bottom navigation bar (with other application sections).
*   **Styling:**  Adherence to the application's existing style guide (assuming one exists).


Screen Requirements
Primary Actions: Modify personal details, change phone number, change email, change language, delete account, log out.
Secondary Actions:  (Potentially) access help or support related to settings.
Screen States: Default state (displaying current settings), loading state (during data updates), success state (after successful changes), error state (after invalid input or failed action).
Feedback Needs:  Clear confirmation messages after successful actions, informative error messages for failed actions, visual indication of loading or processing.
