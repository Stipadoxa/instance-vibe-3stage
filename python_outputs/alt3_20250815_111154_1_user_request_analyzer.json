  "content": "## STAGE 1: UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST\n\n1. **Domain**: E-commerce (specifically, a marketplace showing sellers).\n2. **Platform**: Unclear, but will default to mobile in Stage 3.\n3. **User Goal**: To display a concise summary of a seller's information (avatar and rating) within a list or feed of sellers.\n\n\n## STAGE 2: GENERATE CORE CONTENT\n\n**Main Screen Purpose**: To present a list of sellers, allowing users to quickly identify and select sellers based on their avatar and rating.  This is likely part of a larger product listing or search results page.\n\n\n**Required Information & Actions**:\n\n* **Heading**:  (Not applicable at the row level; this is a single row within a larger list)\n\n* **Key Information Blocks**:\n    * **Avatar Image:** A square profile picture of the seller (e.g., 50x50 pixels).  If no image is available, display a default placeholder image (a generic icon or initials). Example:  `[Display Seller Avatar]`\n    * **Seller Name:** The seller's display name. Example: `Jane's Handmade Crafts`\n    * **Seller Rating:** A star rating (e.g., 4.8 out of 5 stars)  alongside the number of ratings in parentheses. Example: `⭐⭐⭐⭐ (123)`\n\n* **Primary & Secondary Actions**:\n    * **Primary:** Tap/Click on the entire row to navigate to the seller's full profile page.\n    *(No secondary action is explicitly required at the row level.  Additional actions may exist on the seller's profile page.)*\n\n* **Required Status Indicators**: None explicitly required at the row level.\n\n\n## STAGE 3: ADD NAVIGATION (Mobile App Default)\n\n**Top Navigation**: (Not applicable for a single row within a larger list view)\n\n**Bottom Navigation**:  Assuming this seller row is part of a larger product browsing experience:\n\n* **Home:**  Icon: House icon\n* **Browse:** Icon: List icon\n* **Cart:** Icon: Shopping cart icon\n* **Profile:** Icon: Person icon\n\n\n**Example of a complete seller row (for implementation):**\n\n```\n[50x50px Avatar Image]  |  Jane's Handmade Crafts  ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (123)\n```\n(The vertical bar \"|\" represents the visual separation between the avatar and text; the actual implementation would use appropriate layout techniques.)\n",
