  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Communication/Information Delivery domain for mobile application\nUser Type: Mobile application users receiving notifications, requiring quick access to information updates\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need concise information displays due to limited screen real estate; interactions are touch-based; the design must be easily scannable and understandable at a glance.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: View recent notifications, access information within each notification\nSecondary Goals: Mark notifications as read, potentially take actions based on notification content (depending on notification type,  this may be a future enhancement)\nUser Constraints: Limited screen space, touch-only interaction, interruptions possible while viewing notifications\nReady for handoff if: Five notification items are clearly displayed,  each with avatar, title, description, and timestamp; top bar with user info is present; bottom navigation is present;  all UI elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction.\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: User avatar, notification title, notification description, timestamp (for each of the 5 notifications), user information in top bar\nSupporting: Notification read/unread status indicator\nContextual:  Potentially additional information or actions depending on notification type (this is outside the scope of the current request).\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list for notifications, top bar at the top, bottom navigation bar at the bottom.\n* Components: Top bar (User info, potentially a title such as \"Notifications\"), Notification item (User avatar, title, description, timestamp, read/unread indicator), Bottom navigation bar (with appropriate icons and labels).\n* Styling:  Styling details are not specified in the user request and should be addressed in a separate design phase.\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: View notification details (tapping on a notification item).\nSecondary Actions:  None explicitly specified; potential future actions dependent on the notification types.\nScreen States: Default state (showing 5 notifications), potentially a \"no notifications\" state.\nFeedback Needs: Clear visual indication of which notifications are read and unread.\n",
