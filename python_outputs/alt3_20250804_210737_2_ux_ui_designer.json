  "content": "I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.\n\n**DESIGN RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.\n\n2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical structure. The app bar takes up the top section, providing a search bar and filter button.  Below, a horizontal layout with `layoutWrap: \"WRAP\"` allows product cards to dynamically adjust based on screen size.  `itemSpacing` is used to create visual breathing room between elements.  Horizontal sizing is set to `\"FILL\"` for the image within the product card to ensure it fills the available space.  The `product card` component manages its overall width.\n\n3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first sees the search bar at the top, allowing them to quickly search for products.  The filter button provides additional refinement. Product cards are displayed in a visually appealing grid, making it easy to browse and select items.  The card design includes all necessary product information for quick assessment.\n\n4. **Component Choices:** \n    * **AppBar:** I chose the `appbar` component (ID: `10:5620`) over using native elements to create a consistent header experience. It provides built-in styling and layout capabilities.  The variants are set to accommodate the search field and filter button.\n    * **Product Card:** I chose the `product card` component (ID: `147:3743`) because it's designed for product information display in various layouts (\"grid\" variant used here). It is pre-built to display essential information and has placeholder elements to be populated with the product details.   Alternatives considered, but not used were creating a `native-rectangle` or `layoutContainers` in combination, due to the considerable effort that would require for proper styling and consistency with the design system.  The existing component provides a streamlined and optimized solution.\n    * **Search Bar:** The `search-field` component (ID: `10:12086`) was selected for its ease of use and integration with the AppBar, rather than resorting to native elements for search input functionality.\n    * **Button:** The `button` component (ID: `10:3907`) was selected for the filter button to maintain a consistent look and feel with other buttons in the application.\n\n5. **Component Gaps:** The design system doesn't have a dedicated component for a product grid layout, and this functionality was achieved with `layoutContainer` with a horizontal layout that utilizes the \"WRAP\" property. This approach offers responsiveness while ensuring that the product cards layout correctly across various screen sizes.\n\n6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The app bar is placed prominently at the top of the screen, with the search bar as the primary focus. The product cards are then presented in a clear, consistent grid.  The prominence of elements is enhanced by sufficient spacing and visual cues like color and typography (using the design system text styles for consistency).\n\n7. **Variant Selection Rationale:**  The `search-field` component uses the `\"State\": \"default\"` variant as this is the normal state for the search bar. For the `appbar`,  `\"Mode\": \"Light\"`, `\"Type\": \"search-field\"`, and `\"Elevation\": \"flat\"` variants were chosen to match the light theme and search bar intent. The \"grid\" variant is used for the `product card` to achieve a grid layout for the products.  These specific variant choices help create a consistent and unified design experience.\n\n\n8. **Native Element Justification:** No native elements were necessary for this design. All requirements were met using existing components from the design system.\n\n\n**DESIGN SPECIFICATION:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layoutContainer\": {\n    \"name\": \"Product Listing\",\n    \"layoutMode\": \"VERTICAL\",\n    \"itemSpacing\": 0,\n    \"paddingTop\": 0,\n    \"paddingBottom\": 0,\n    \"paddingLeft\": 0,\n    \"paddingRight\": 0,\n    \"primaryAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"counterAxisSizingMode\": \"AUTO\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"component\",\n        \"id\": \"10:5620\",\n        \"variants\": {\n          \"Mode\": \"Light\",\n          \"Type\": \"search-field\",\n          \"Elevation\": \"flat\"\n        },\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:12086\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Device\": \"Mobile\",\n              \"State\": \"default\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"10:3907\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"Platform\": \"Android+Web\",\n              \"Size\": \"Medium\",\n              \"Type\": \"Text\",\n              \"State\": \"Default\",\n              \"Color\": \"Green\"\n            },\n            \"textLayers\": {\n              \"Action\": \"Filter\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"layoutContainer\",\n        \"layoutMode\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n        \"layoutGrow\": 1,\n        \"layoutWrap\": \"WRAP\",\n        \"itemSpacing\": 16,\n        \"paddingTop\": 16,\n        \"paddingBottom\": 16,\n        \"paddingLeft\": 16,\n        \"paddingRight\": 16,\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            },\n            \"textLayers\": {\n              \"#title\": \"Product Title 1\",\n              \"#price\": \"100\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"4.5\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"(10)\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"component\",\n            \"id\": \"147:3743\",\n            \"variants\": {\n              \"view\": \"grid\",\n              \"type\": \"normal\"\n            },\n            \"textLayers\": {\n              \"#title\": \"Product Title 2\",\n              \"#price\": \"200\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"4.0\",\n              \"#attribute1 value\": \"(20)\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
