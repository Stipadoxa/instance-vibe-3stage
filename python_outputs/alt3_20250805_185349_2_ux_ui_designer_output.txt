I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The layout uses a vertical layout container for the overall structure.  A `layoutContainer` with `layoutMode: "HORIZONTAL"` and `layoutWrap: "WRAP"` is used to create the product grid, allowing for responsive scaling across different screen sizes.  The search bar and filter button are positioned at the top within their own horizontal container to maintain visual separation. Consistent 16px padding is applied to major content sections for breathability.  Product cards use `horizontalSizing: "AUTO"` to adjust to content width.


3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The user first sees the search bar at the top to initiate their search. The filter button provides additional refinement options. Search results are presented in a visually appealing grid layout, allowing for easy browsing. Each product card displays essential information (image, title, price, rating) and allows for selection.

4. **Component Choices:**  
    * **Search Bar:** I chose the `10:12086` ("search-field") component for the search bar because it's specifically designed for this purpose, provides built-in styling, and is compliant with the design system.  Alternatives like building a custom search bar with `native-rectangle` and `native-text` were considered but were rejected to maintain design system consistency.
    * **Filter Button:** The `10:3907` ("Button") component is ideal as a filter button as it is a standard button component with numerous built-in styling and interaction options. Creating a custom button with native elements would require more effort and be inconsistent with the design system.
    * **Product Cards:**  The design system lacks a suitable "product card" component that includes image, title, price, and rating as a single unit. Therefore, a custom layout was created (detailed in Design Specification).

5. **Component Gaps:** The design system lacks a dedicated "product card" component, integrating image, title, price, and rating seamlessly.  To address this gap, a `layoutContainer` was used to group the required `native-rectangle` (for the image), `native-text` (for the title, price), and multiple `635:4752` ("icon/star") components (for the rating). This approach provides a visually consistent card while respecting design system limitations.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The search bar and filter button have higher visual prominence due to their top position and larger size.  Product cards are clearly grouped in the grid, emphasizing browse-ability.  Within each card, the product title is the most prominent, followed by the price and then the rating.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the search bar (`10:12086`), the `"State": "default"` variant is used initially because the user begins with an empty search. The `10:3907` ("Button") component's `"Size": "Medium"` and `"Color": "Green"` variants were chosen for optimal visibility and interaction based on default component sizes in the design system.

8. **Native Element Justification:** The absence of a dedicated "product card" component necessitated the use of `native-rectangle`, `native-text`, and `635:4752` ("icon/star") components to create a custom layout for each product within the constraints of the native element types allowed. This offers the necessary functionality while adhering to the principle of using native elements only to address functional gaps, not purely stylistic ones.
