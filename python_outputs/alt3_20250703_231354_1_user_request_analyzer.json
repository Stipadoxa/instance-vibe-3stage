  "content": "User Request: \"calendar view\"\nPlatform: Desktop\n\n\n**Domain & Context**\n\nDomain: Scheduling and time management domain.  This could be for personal use, or part of a larger business/SaaS application.\nUser Type: Desktop users who need to manage their schedule efficiently. This could range from individuals managing personal appointments to professionals managing complex project timelines.\nPlatform Impact: Desktop users expect detailed views, precise control via keyboard and mouse, and the ability to multitask while viewing the calendar.  Complex layouts and interactions are feasible.\n\n\n**User Requirements**\n\nPrimary Goals: View scheduled events, create new events, edit existing events.\nSecondary Goals:  Navigate between different views (day, week, month, year), filter events by category or type, search for specific events, share calendar information with others, set reminders.\nUser Constraints: Users might need to manage large numbers of events, require precise time selection, need to integrate with other applications (email, contacts), and may require different views depending on their use case (e.g., a detailed hourly view vs. a monthly overview).\n\n\n**Ready for handoff if:**  The current date is clearly highlighted, events are clearly displayed with essential information (time, title, location), navigation between views is intuitive and clearly labeled, and the primary actions (create, edit, delete) are easily accessible and prominent.\n\n\n**Content Requirements**\n\nCritical: Display of events with start/end times, titles, locations, and optional descriptions. Date navigation controls (previous/next day/week/month).\nSupporting:  Different view options (day, week, month, year), filtering options, search functionality, color-coding for different event types, reminders.\nContextual:  Integration with other applications, user's availability shown (busy/free slots), visual cues for recurring events.\n\n\n**Screen Requirements**\n\nPrimary Actions: Create new event, edit existing event, delete event.\nSecondary Actions: Switch views (day, week, month, year), filter events, search events, share calendar, access settings.\nScreen States: Default view (e.g., weekly view), event creation/editing mode, loading state (if fetching data), error states (e.g., conflict with existing events).\n\n\n**Feedback Needs:**  Clear visual feedback on event creation/editing success or failure, clear indication of the current date and view, appropriate visual cues for time conflicts, loading indicators during data retrieval.\n",
