  "content": "Domain & Context\nDomain: Business/SaaS domain with user account management\nUser Type: Mobile users managing their account settings and preferences.\nPlatform Impact: Mobile users need a concise, easily navigable settings screen with clear touch targets and minimal scrolling.  Limited screen real estate necessitates prioritization of settings.\n\nUser Requirements\nPrimary Goals: Access and modify personal and business details, manage notification preferences, securely change account credentials, and log out of the application.\nSecondary Goals:  Easily disable features (chats and feedback), delete account (carefully guided process).\nUser Constraints: Small screen size, touch-only interaction, potential for interruptions, users may be unfamiliar with some settings.\nReady for handoff if: All settings are clearly labeled and accessible, actions are confirmed before execution (especially account deletion), top and bottom app bars are implemented, and touch targets meet minimum size requirements.\n\n\nContent Requirements\nCritical: Personal details (view and edit), business details (view and edit), change phone number, change email, change language, change password, log out.\nSupporting: Disable chats, disable feedback, manage notifications.\nContextual:  Confirmation dialog before account deletion, success/error messages for setting changes, loading indicators during data saving.\n\n\nStructural & Component Directives\n* Layout: Vertical list of settings items.  Items should be grouped logically (e.g., Personal, Business, Account).\n* Components: Top app bar (with back button), list items (each with label and potentially a right-pointing arrow or toggle), bottom app bar (potentially with a save button if settings are not auto-saved).\n* Styling: Consistent with overall app styling guidelines.\n\n\nScreen Requirements\nPrimary Actions: Modify settings, log out.\nSecondary Actions:  Navigate to detailed views for specific settings (e.g., Manage Notifications).\nScreen States: Default state, loading state (when saving changes), success state (after saving changes), error state (if changes fail).\nFeedback Needs:  Clear visual cues for successful setting changes, appropriate loading indicators, informative error messages.\n",
