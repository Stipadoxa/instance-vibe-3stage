I have verified all component references against the provided design system data.

**DESIGN RATIONALE:**

1. **Component Inventory Verification:**  All component IDs used in the design specification below have been verified against the provided `DESIGN_SYSTEM_DATA`.

2. **Layout Decisions:** The dashboard homepage uses a vertical layout.  The top section contains stats cards arranged horizontally with `itemSpacing` of 16.  Each stat card has a fixed width to ensure even distribution. Below the stats, a vertical layout displays the recent activity feed, allowing for a scrolling list of items.  Action buttons are placed at the bottom before the navigation. 16pt padding is used around main sections for visual breathing room. The bottom navigation bar is a full-width component, positioned at the very bottom of the screen.


3. **User Flow Reasoning:** The design prioritizes quick access to key information and actions for sellers. Stats cards provide immediate performance feedback, followed by a recent activity feed for timely updates. Prominent action buttons encourage engagement with core functionalities (creating listings and managing messages). Bottom navigation ensures easy access to other sections of the seller dashboard.

4. **Component Choices:** I chose `10:4724` (Bottom navigation) for the bottom navigation because it's the dedicated component designed for this purpose within the design system.  Alternatives weren't considered as this component perfectly meets the requirement. I chose `10:3907` (Button) for action buttons because of its readily available variants (Size, Type, Color) to make it match the overall design better.


5. **Component Gaps:** The design requires stat cards (displaying key metrics like total listings, views, and messages), which are not explicitly available in the provided design system. To address this gap, I've created a workaround using a combination of `native-rectangle` for the card background and `native-text` for displaying values, achieving the necessary functionality while maintaining a consistent visual style using the existing color palette. Similarly, an activity feed is needed but not a standard component. I created this using the `10:10214` (List item) component repeatedly within a vertical layout container.  This approach provides a structured and visually appealing way to display the activity feed.

6. **Visual Hierarchy:** The visual hierarchy is established through size, spacing, and color.  Headline text for stats is larger and bolder than body text. Stat cards are grouped together at the top to emphasize performance metrics. Action buttons have a more prominent color (primary) to stand out.

7. **Variant Selection Rationale:** For the bottom navigation (`10:4724`), the "Mobile" variant is chosen to adapt the navigation to the mobile device screen size and ensures that it's optimally viewed in this context. For the buttons, I've used variants to create primary filled buttons for clear calls to action.


8. **Native Element Justification:**  `native-rectangle` and `native-text` elements are used to create the stat cards because a dedicated "stat card" component is missing from the design system. These native elements fulfill the functional requirement of displaying key metrics within visually appealing cards while ensuring consistency with existing color palettes and typography.
